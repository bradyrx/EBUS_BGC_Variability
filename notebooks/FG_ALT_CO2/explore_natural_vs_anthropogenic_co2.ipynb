      "# Exploring Natural vs. Anthropogenic CO$_{2}$\n",
      "After ICDC, we realized that it isn't exactly clear what our residuals represent. For awhile, we portrayed them as simply \"natural CO$_{2}$.\" We realized recently, that embedded in the ensemble mean is a strong seasonal cycle. The trend within the ensemble mean is likely the anthropogenic invasion of carbon, but what is this seasonal cycle? Surely it isn't purely anthropogenic carbon, so these residuals more likely represent variability in natural CO2 due to internally generated variability. \n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of this notebook is to use FG_ALT_CO2 output to understand what all of our time series components represent. The same processing has been done to the FG_ALT_CO2 output as other variables: it has been area-weighted over each region and split into the ensemble mean and residuals. The output itself was generated with the same dynamics of each run but with constant pre-industrial CO2 levels. Thus, it represents purely natural CO2 flux. We can take FG_CO2 - FG_ALT_CO2 to accurately extract anthropogenic carbon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The questions we are trying to answer here are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. What do the residuals represent from the FG_CO2 runs?\n",
      "2. Is there any trend in the FG_ALT_CO2 timeseries?\n",
      "3. Does the seasonal cycle show up in the FG_ALT_CO2 output? What drives that seasonal cycle?\n",
      "\n",
      "Once we answer these fundamental questions, we can go on to really quantify and characterize the full time series from the historical runs."

After detrending the contemporary (FG_CO2) and natural (FG_ALT_CO2) time series ensemble means, we find that 99.6% of the variability of the contemporary time series is explained by the natural time series. The interesting thing is that it seems as though the total amplitude might slightly grow, and it could be driven by the anthropogenic perturbation.

      "The eye test shows that these internally generated residuals (\"internally generated variability in CO2 fluxes\") are due primarily to natural CO2, but as time evolves, anthropogenic CO2 becomes increasingly important. This was an important excursion to take with the data, to really get all the definitions correct.\n",

      "For every EBUS contemporary CO$_{2}$ flux time series, we now have a few components to characterize historically:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The \"level\" or mean state of our region. This is simply the mean across the whole time series. Is this generally an outgassing or uptake site?\n",
      "2. The \"trend\" of the region. We have shown here that this is purely due to the anthropogenic invasion of carbon and should be toward a sink in every location.\n",
      "3. The \"seasonal\" component of the region. What is the mean amplitude of the seasonal cycle for each region (derived from the detrended ensemble mean)? We have shown here that this is primarily natural carbon, but as time goes on, part of the seasonal cycle is due to anthropogenic carbon.\n",
      "4. The \"residual\" component for each simulation. This is the internally generated variabiliy, which is primarily natural, but also includes some anthropogenic carbon. This is what generally controls the \"variability\" of the system we are trying to get at with the large ensemble."
