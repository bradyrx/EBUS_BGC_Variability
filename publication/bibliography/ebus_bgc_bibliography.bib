	Abstract = {We investigate the impact of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on surface wind, sea surface temperature (SST), and surface chlorophyll concentration on intraseasonal to interannual timescales in the Southern Ocean using 8-day average satellite observations. Positive phases of the SAM are associated with enhanced westerly winds over the Antarctic Zone (AZ) and Polar Frontal Zone, driving increased equatorward Ekman transport and cold SST anomalies in these regions. Positive SAM is also associated with easterly wind and warm SST anomalies in the Subtropical Zone. South of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), chlorophyll concentration anomalies are positively correlated with the SAM, however this correlation is negative north of the APF. We suggest that the positive correlation in the AZ is due to the increased supply of iron by upwelling, while the negative correlation north of the APF is caused by stronger light limitation as a consequence of deeper mixed layers.},

@article{Lovenduski:2007,
	Abstract = {We investigate the interannual variability in the flux of CO2 between the atmosphere and the Southern Ocean on the basis of hindcast simulations with a coupled physical-biogeochemical-ecological model with particular emphasis on the role of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The simulations are run under either pre-industrial or historical CO2 concentrations, permitting us to separately investigate natural, anthropogenic, and contemporary CO2 flux variability. We find large interannual variability ($\pm$0.19 PgC yr−1) in the contemporary air-sea CO2 flux from the Southern Ocean ({\textless}35$\,^{\circ}$S). Forty-three percent of the contemporary air-sea CO2 flux variance is coherent with SAM, mostly driven by variations in the flux of natural CO2, for which SAM explains 48\%. Positive phases of the SAM are associated with anomalous outgassing of natural CO2 at a rate of 0.1 PgC yr−1 per standard deviation of the SAM. In contrast, we find an anomalous uptake of anthropogenic CO2 at a rate of 0.01 PgC yr−1 during positive phases of the SAM. This uptake of anthropogenic CO2 only slightly mitigates the outgassing of natural CO2, so that a positive SAM is associated with anomalous outgassing in contemporaneous times. The primary cause of the natural CO2 outgassing is anomalously high oceanic partial pressures of CO2 caused by elevated dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations. These anomalies in DIC are primarily a result of the circulation changes associated with the southward shift and strengthening of the zonal winds during positive phases of the SAM. The secular, positive trend in the SAM has led to a reduction in the rate of increase of the uptake of CO2 by the Southern Ocean over the past 50 years.},

@article{Takahashi:2002,
	Abstract = {Based on about 940,000 measurements of surface-water pCO2 obtained since the International Geophysical Year of 1956--59, the climatological, monthly distribution of pCO2 in the global surface waters representing mean non-El Ni{\~n}o conditions has been obtained with a spatial resolution of 4$\,^{\circ}$×5$\,^{\circ}$ for a reference year 1995. The monthly and annual net sea--air CO2 flux has been computed using the NCEP/NCAR 41-year mean monthly wind speeds. An annual net uptake flux of CO2 by the global oceans has been estimated to be 2.2 (+22\% or −19\%)Pg Cyr−1 using the (wind speed)2 dependence of the CO2 gas transfer velocity of Wanninkhof (J. Geophys. Res. 97 (1992) 7373). The errors associated with the wind-speed variation have been estimated using one standard deviation (about$\pm$2ms−1) from the mean monthly wind speed observed over each 4$\,^{\circ}$×5$\,^{\circ}$ pixel area of the global oceans. The new global uptake flux obtained with the Wanninkhof (wind speed)2 dependence is compared with those obtained previously using a smaller number of measurements, about 250,000 and 550,000, respectively, and are found to be consistent within$\pm$0.2Pg Cyr−1. This estimate for the global ocean uptake flux is consistent with the values of 2.0$\pm$0.6Pg Cyr−1 estimated on the basis of the observed changes in the atmospheric CO2 and oxygen concentrations during the 1990s (Nature 381 (1996) 218; Science 287 (2000) 2467). However, if the (wind speed)3 dependence of Wanninkhof and McGillis (Res. Lett. 26 (1999) 1889) is used instead, the annual ocean uptake as well as the sensitivity to wind-speed variability is increased by about 70\%. A zone between 40$\,^{\circ}$ and 60$\,^{\circ}$ latitudes in both the northern and southern hemispheres is found to be a major sink for atmospheric CO2. In these areas, poleward-flowing warm waters meet and mix with the cold subpolar waters rich in nutrients. The pCO2 in the surface water is decreased by the cooling effect on warm waters and by the biological drawdown of pCO2 in subpolar waters. High wind speeds over these low pCO2 waters increase the CO2 uptake rate by the ocean waters. The pCO2 in surface waters of the global oceans varies seasonally over a wide range of about 60\% above and below the current atmospheric pCO2 level of about 360μatm. A global map showing the seasonal amplitude of surface-water pCO2 is presented. The effect of biological utilization of CO2 is differentiated from that of seasonal temperature changes using seasonal temperature data. The seasonal amplitude of surface-water pCO2 in high-latitude waters located poleward of about 40$\,^{\circ}$ latitude and in the equatorial zone is dominated by the biology effect, whereas that in the temperate gyre regions is dominated by the temperature effect. These effects are about 6 months out of phase. Accordingly, along the boundaries between these two regimes, they tend to cancel each other, forming a zone of small pCO2 amplitude. In the oligotrophic waters of the northern and southern temperate gyres, the biology effect is about 35μatm on average. This is consistent with the biological export flux estimated by Laws et al. (Glob. Biogeochem. Cycles 14 (2000) 1231). Small areas such as the northwestern Arabian Sea and the eastern equatorial Pacific, where seasonal upwelling occurs, exhibit intense seasonal changes in pCO2 due to the biological drawdown of CO2.
Une distribution climatologique mensuelle moyenne de pCO2 de surface de l'oc{\'e}an mondial a {\'e}t{\'e} {\'e}tablie pour l'ann{\'e}e 1995 (pour les ann{\'e}es sans El Ni{\~n}o) {\`a} partir de 940.000 mesures dans les eaux de surface, acquises depuis l'Ann{\'e}e G{\'e}ophysique Internationale (1956--59), avec une r{\'e}solution spatiale de 4$\,^{\circ}$×5$\,^{\circ}$. Les flux de CO2 air-mer ont {\'e}t{\'e} ensuite calcul{\'e}s, {\`a} l'{\'e}chelle mensuelle et annuelle, en utilisant la distribution des vents mensuels du NCEP/NCAR moyenn{\'e}s sur 41 ans. Le flux net oc{\'e}anique global de CO2 a {\'e}t{\'e} estim{\'e} {\`a} un puits de 2.2 (+22\% ou --19\%) Pg Can−1 en utilisant l'{\'e}quation de Wanninkhof (Geophys. Res. 97 (1992) 7373) dans laquelle le coefficient de transfert (ou la vitesse de piston) du CO2 est exprim{\'e} en fonction du carr{\'e} de la vitesse du vent; les incertitudes associ{\'e}es {\`a} la vitesse du vent ont {\'e}t{\'e} calcul{\'e}es en utilisant une erreur standard de $\pm$2ms−1 pour un vent moyen observ{\'e} sur chaque pixel de 4$\,^{\circ}$×5$\,^{\circ}$ de l'oc{\'e}an global. Le nouveau flux global ainsi calcul{\'e} (carr{\'e} de la vitesse du vent dans le coefficient de transfert) est {\`a} 0.2Pg Can−1 pr{\`e}s, en accord avec nos estimations ant{\'e}rieures bas{\'e}es respectivement sur 250.000 et 550.000 mesures seulement. Ce r{\'e}sultat est {\'e}galement compatible avec les estimations de 2.0$\pm$0.6PgCan−1 de Keeling et al. (Nature 381 (1996) 218) et de Battle et al. (Science 287 (2000) 2467) bas{\'e}es sur la variation des teneurs en CO2 et oxyg{\`e}ne atmosph{\'e}riques pendant la d{\'e}cennie des ann{\'e}es 90. Cependant l'utilisation de l'{\'e}quation de Wanninkhof et McGillis (Res. Lett. 26 (1999) 1889), faisant intervenir le coefficient de transfert de CO2 exprim{\'e} en fonction du cube de la vitesse du vent, donne des valeurs du flux annuel global ainsi que la sensibilit{\'e} {\`a} la variation de la vitesse du vent plus {\'e}lev{\'e}es de 70\%. Le puits majeur de CO2 atmosph{\'e}rique est situ{\'e} dans la bande de latitude comprise entre 40 et 60$\,^{\circ}$ pour les deux h{\'e}misph{\`e}res, o{\`u} les eaux chaudes se dirigeant vers vers le p{\^o}le convergent et se m{\'e}langent avec des eaux froides subpolaires riches en sels nutritifs. La diminution de pCO2 des eaux de surface subpolaires est due {\`a} la fois {\`a} leur refroidissement et {\`a} la pompe biologique. L'intensit{\'e} des vents dans ces r{\'e}gions o{\`u} pCO2 est faible en surface intensifie encore le pompage de CO2. La variation saisonni{\`e}re de pCO2 dans les eaux de surface de l'oc{\'e}an global peut atteindre $\pm$60\% de la valeur actuelle de pCO2 atmosph{\'e}rique moyen (360μatm). Une carte de l'amplitude de la variation saisonni{\`e}re de pCO2 dans les eaux de surface ainsi que l'effet de l'utilisation du CO2 par la production biologique et l'influence de la variation saisonni{\`e}re de la temp{\'e}rature (estim{\'e}e en utilisant des donn{\'e}es saisonni{\`e}res de temp{\'e}rature) sont pr{\'e}sent{\'e}es s{\'e}par{\'e}ment. La variation saisonni{\`e}re de pCO2 des eaux de surface situ{\'e}es entre les p{\^o}les et environ 40$\,^{\circ}$ et celles des r{\'e}gions {\'e}quatoriales est principalement due {\`a} l'effet de la pompe biologique, alors que dans les tourbillons des r{\'e}gions centrales c'est l'effet thermique qui domine, ces deux effets {\'e}tant d{\'e}phas{\'e}s d'environ 6 mois. En cons{\'e}quence, dans les r{\'e}gions fronti{\`e}res de ces deux zones les effets thermique et biologique se compensent, ce qui engendre des variations saisonni{\`e}res de pCO2 de faible amplitude. Dans les eaux oligotrophes des tourbillons centraux des r{\'e}gions temp{\'e}r{\'e}es, l'influence de la biologie est estim{\'e} {\`a} 35μatm en moyenne, ce qui est compatible avec le flux biologique export{\'e} estim{\'e} par Laws et al. (Glob. Biogeochem. Cycles 14 (2000) 1231). L'importance de l'effet biologique sur pCO2 d{\`u} {\`a} l'intensit{\'e} des remont{\'e}es saisonni{\`e}res d'eaux a {\'e}t{\'e} mis en {\'e}vidence dans des r{\'e}gions de surface limit{\'e}es du nord-ouest de la mer d'Arabie et du Pacifique est-{\'e}quatorial.},

	Abstract = {The North Atlantic is believed to represent the largest ocean sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide in the Northern Hemisphere, yet little is known about its temporal variability. We report an 18-year time series of upper-ocean inorganic carbon observations from the northwestern subtropical North Atlantic near Bermuda that indicates substantial variability in this sink. We deduce that the carbon variability at this site is largely driven by variations in winter mixed-layer depths and by sea surface temperature anomalies. Because these variations tend to occur in a basinwide coordinated pattern associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation, it is plausible that the entire North Atlantic Ocean may vary in concert, resulting in a variability of the strength of the North Atlantic carbon sink of about $\pm$0.3 petagrams of carbon per year (1 petagram = 1015grams) or nearly $\pm$50\%. This extrapolation is supported by basin-wide estimates from atmospheric carbon dioxide inversions.},

	Abstract = {The Atlantic Ocean is one of the most important sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), but this sink has been shown to vary substantially in time. Here we use surface ocean CO2 observations to estimate this sink and the temporal variability from 1998 through 2007 in the Atlantic Ocean. We benefit from (i) a continuous improvement of the observations, i.e. the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) v1.5 database and (ii) a newly developed technique to interpolate the observations in space and time. In particular, we use a two-step neural network approach to reconstruct basin-wide monthly maps of the sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) at a resolution of 1$\,^{\circ}$ × 1$\,^{\circ}$. From those, we compute the air--sea CO2 flux maps using a standard gas exchange parameterization and high-resolution wind speeds. The neural networks fit the observed pCO2 data with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 10 μatm and with almost no bias. A check against independent time-series data and new data from SOCAT v2 reveals a larger RMSE of 22.8 μatm for the entire Atlantic Ocean, which decreases to 16.3 μatm for data south of 40$\,^{\circ}$ N. We estimate a decadal mean uptake flux of −0.45 $\pm$ 0.15 Pg C yr−1 for the Atlantic between 44$\,^{\circ}$ S and 79$\,^{\circ}$ N, representing the sum of a strong uptake north of 18$\,^{\circ}$ N (−0.39 $\pm$ 0.10 Pg C yr−1), outgassing in the tropics (18$\,^{\circ}$ S--18$\,^{\circ}$ N, 0.11 $\pm$ 0.07 Pg C yr−1), and uptake in the subtropical/temperate South Atlantic south of 18$\,^{\circ}$ S (−0.16 $\pm$ 0.06 Pg C yr−1), consistent with recent studies. The strongest seasonal variability of the CO2 flux occurs in the temperature-driven subtropical North Atlantic, with uptake in winter and outgassing in summer. The seasonal cycle is antiphased in the subpolar latitudes relative to the subtropics largely as a result of the biologically driven winter-to-summer drawdown of CO2. Over the 10 yr analysis period (1998 through 2007), sea surface pCO2 increased faster than that of the atmosphere in large areas poleward of 40$\,^{\circ}$ N, while in other regions of the North Atlantic the sea surface pCO2 increased at a slower rate, resulting in a barely changing Atlantic carbon sink north of the Equator (−0.01 $\pm$ 0.02 Pg C yr−1 decade−1). Surface ocean pCO2 increased at a slower rate relative to atmospheric CO2 over most of the Atlantic south of the Equator, leading to a substantial trend toward a stronger CO2 sink for the entire South Atlantic (−0.14 $\pm$ 0.02 Pg C yr−1 decade−1). In contrast to the 10 yr trends, the Atlantic Ocean carbon sink varies relatively little on inter-annual timescales ($\pm$0.04 Pg C yr−1; 1 σ).},

	Abstract = {A climatological mean distribution for the surface water pCO2 over the global oceans in non-El Ni{\~n}o conditions has been constructed with spatial resolution of 4$\,^{\circ}$ (latitude) ×5$\,^{\circ}$ (longitude) for a reference year 2000 based upon about 3 million measurements of surface water pCO2 obtained from 1970 to 2007. The database used for this study is about 3 times larger than the 0.94 million used for our earlier paper [Takahashi et al., 2002. Global sea--air CO2 flux based on climatological surface ocean pCO2, and seasonal biological and temperature effects. Deep-Sea Res. II, 49, 1601--1622]. A time-trend analysis using deseasonalized surface water pCO2 data in portions of the North Atlantic, North and South Pacific and Southern Oceans (which cover about 27\% of the global ocean areas) indicates that the surface water pCO2 over these oceanic areas has increased on average at a mean rate of 1.5μatmy−1 with basin-specific rates varying between 1.2$\pm$0.5 and 2.1$\pm$0.4μatmy−1. A global ocean database for a single reference year 2000 is assembled using this mean rate for correcting observations made in different years to the reference year. The observations made during El Ni{\~n}o periods in the equatorial Pacific and those made in coastal zones are excluded from the database. Seasonal changes in the surface water pCO2 and the sea-air pCO2 difference over four climatic zones in the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Southern Oceans are presented. Over the Southern Ocean seasonal ice zone, the seasonality is complex. Although it cannot be thoroughly documented due to the limited extent of observations, seasonal changes in pCO2 are approximated by using the data for under-ice waters during austral winter and those for the marginal ice and ice-free zones. The net air--sea CO2 flux is estimated using the sea--air pCO2 difference and the air--sea gas transfer rate that is parameterized as a function of (wind speed)2 with a scaling factor of 0.26. This is estimated by inverting the bomb 14C data using Ocean General Circulation models and the 1979--2005 NCEP-DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis (R-2) wind speed data. The equatorial Pacific (14$\,^{\circ}$N--14$\,^{\circ}$S) is the major source for atmospheric CO2, emitting about +0.48Pg-Cy−1, and the temperate oceans between 14$\,^{\circ}$ and 50$\,^{\circ}$ in the both hemispheres are the major sink zones with an uptake flux of −0.70Pg-Cy−1 for the northern and −1.05Pg-Cy−1 for the southern zone. The high-latitude North Atlantic, including the Nordic Seas and portion of the Arctic Sea, is the most intense CO2 sink area on the basis of per unit area, with a mean of −2.5tons-Cmonth−1km−2. This is due to the combination of the low pCO2 in seawater and high gas exchange rates. In the ice-free zone of the Southern Ocean (50$\,^{\circ}$--62$\,^{\circ}$S), the mean annual flux is small (−0.06Pg-Cy−1) because of a cancellation of the summer uptake CO2 flux with the winter release of CO2 caused by deepwater upwelling. The annual mean for the contemporary net CO2 uptake flux over the global oceans is estimated to be −1.6$\pm$0.9Pg-Cy−1, which includes an undersampling correction to the direct estimate of −1.4$\pm$0.7Pg-Cy−1. Taking the pre-industrial steady-state ocean source of 0.4$\pm$0.2Pg-Cy−1 into account, the total ocean uptake flux including the anthropogenic CO2 is estimated to be −2.0$\pm$1.0Pg-Cy−1 in 2000.},

@article{Kay:2015,
	Abstract = { AbstractWhile internal climate variability is known to affect climate projections, its influence is often underappreciated and confused with model error. Why? In general, modeling centers contribute a small number of realizations to international climate model assessments [e.g., phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)]. As a result, model error and internal climate variability are difficult, and at times impossible, to disentangle. In response, the Community Earth System Model (CESM) community designed the CESM Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) with the explicit goal of enabling assessment of climate change in the presence of internal climate variability. All CESM-LE simulations use a single CMIP5 model (CESM with the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5). The core simulations replay the twenty to twenty-first century (1920--2100) 30 times under historical and representative concentration pathway 8.5 external forcing with small initial condition differences. Two companion 1000+-yr-long preindustrial control simulations (fully coupled, prognostic atmosphere and land only) allow assessment of internal climate variability in the absence of climate change. Comprehensive outputs, including many daily fields, are available as single-variable time series on the Earth System Grid for anyone to use. Early results demonstrate the substantial influence of internal climate variability on twentieth- to twenty-first-century climate trajectories. Global warming hiatus decades occur, similar to those recently observed. Internal climate variability alone can produce projection spread comparable to that in CMIP5. Scientists and stakeholders can use CESM-LE outputs to help interpret the observational record, to understand projection spread and to plan for a range of possible futures influenced by both internal climate variability and forced climate change. },

	Abstract = {The 2015--2016 El Ni{\~n}o contributed to large anomalies across the California Current System (CalCS), but these anomalies ceased unexpectedly in late 2015. Here we use a suite of three hindcast simulations with the Regional Oceanic Modeling System to assess the responsible mechanisms for this development. We find that the early buildup was primarily driven by the early onset of this event in the tropical Pacific, driving anomalies in the CalCS through the propagation of coastally trapped waves. In contrast, the abrupt end in the central CalCS was caused by the unusual onset of upwelling favorable winds in the fall of 2015, which offset the continuing remote forcing through the coastal waveguide. Nevertheless, low-nutrient anomalies persisted, causing anomalously low phytoplankton abundance in the upwelling season of 2016. This is a recurring pattern for all El Ni{\~n}o events over the last 37 years, suggesting predictive skill on seasonal timescales.},
