	Abstract = { AbstractInternal variability in the climate system gives rise to large uncertainty in projections of future climate. The uncertainty in future climate due to internal climate variability can be estimated from large ensembles of climate change simulations in which the experiment setup is the same from one ensemble member to the next but for small perturbations in the initial atmospheric state. However, large ensembles are invariably computationally expensive and susceptible to model bias.Here the authors outline an alternative approach for assessing the role of internal variability in future climate based on a simple analytic model and the statistics of the unforced climate variability. The analytic model is derived from the standard error of the regression and assumes that the statistics of the internal variability are roughly Gaussian and stationary in time. When applied to the statistics of an unforced control simulation, the analytic model provides a remarkably robust estimate of the uncertainty in future climate indicated by a large ensemble of climate change simulations. To the extent that observations can be used to estimate the amplitude of internal climate variability, it is argued that the uncertainty in future climate trends due to internal variability can be robustly estimated from the statistics of the observed climate. },

@article{Cropper:2014,
	Abstract = {Seasonal coastal upwelling was analyzed along the NW African coastline (11--35$\,^{\circ}$N) from 1981 to 2012. Upwelling magnitudes are calculated by wind speed indices, sea-surface temperature indices and inferred from meteorological station, sea-surface height and vertical water column transport data. A permanent annual upwelling regime is documented across 21--35$\,^{\circ}$N and a seasonal regime across 12--19$\,^{\circ}$N, in accordance with the climatology of previous studies. Upwelling regions were split into three zones: (1) the Mauritania--Senegalese upwelling zone (12--19$\,^{\circ}$N), (2) the strong permanent annual upwelling zone (21--26$\,^{\circ}$N) and (3) the weak permanent upwelling zone (26--35$\,^{\circ}$N). We find compelling evidence in our various indices for the Bakun upwelling intensification hypothesis due to a significant coastal summer wind speed increase, resulting in an increase in upwelling-favorable wind speeds north of 20$\,^{\circ}$N and an increase in downwelling-favorable winds south of 20$\,^{\circ}$N. The North Atlantic Oscillation plays a leading role in modifying interannual variability during the other seasons (autumn--spring), with its influence dominating in winter. The East Atlantic pattern shows a strong correlation with upwelling during spring, while El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation teleconnections were not found. A disagreement between observationally-based wind speed products and reanalysis-derived data is explored. A modification to the Bakun upwelling intensification hypothesis for NW Africa is presented, which accounts for the latitudinal divide in summer wind regimes.},

@article{Shannon:1986,
	Abstract = {Since the early 1950s, although there have been several warm and cool periods in the Benguela region off southwestern Africa, e.g. the warm event in the southern part of the system during the austral summer of 1982/83, only two events which approximate to an El Ni{\~n}o-type situation have occurred, viz in 1963 and in 1984. During the 1963 event temperatures 2--4$\,^{\circ}$C and salinities 0.1--0.2 × 10−3 above normal were recorded in the upper 50 m off Namibia up to at least 150 km offshore. The pressure adjusted sea level during 1963 was on average 4 cm above the mean. During early 1984 an intrusion of equatorial water moved southward along the coast of northern and central Namibia to 25S. This most recent Benguela Ni{\~n}o was preceded by an extended period of vigorous upwelling during 1982 and 1983. Higher than average pressure adjusted sea levels were recorded at Walvis Bay between October 1983 and September 1984 with maximum positive monthly anomalies of 7 cm during March and August 1984. Equatorward windstress was above average during both the 1963 and 1984 events. Although long time series in the Benguela are few, historic records indicate that in March 1950 the 27$\,^{\circ}$C isotherm in the eastern Atlantic lay 600 km further south than normal, while there is evidence that a major El Ni{\~n}o-like event occurred here between February and August 1934, with sea temperatures 2--3$\,^{\circ}$C above the long term average from March to July 1934. During the 1934 perturbation there was a reported slackening and reversal of the usual equatorward surface flow of the Benguela current and abnormally high rainfall occurred which resulted in extensive flooding of Namib Desert rivers. High rainfall over the Namib was recorded in 1950 and 1963 while some flooding occurred in 1984. Conditions were clearly anomalous in low latitudes in the Atlantic in 1934 and 1963, while there was a major perturbation in the equatorial Atlantic in 1984. This strongly suggests a nonlocal cause of the Benguela anomalies. It is suggested that there is a South Atlantic equivalent of the Pacific El Ni{\~n}o, but that in the Benguela region these events are less pronounced and less frequent. Their causal mechanism may also be different. The effect of these events on the southern Benguela is minimal.},

@article{Frischknecht:2015,
	Abstract = {Much of the observed interannual variability in the physical and biogeochemical state of the California Current System (CalCS) is associated with El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation. Yet it is unclear whether this is primarily a result of atmospheric teleconnections forcing the ocean locally through changes in wind and fluxes of heat and freshwater, or whether this is a consequence of oceanic interior processes that transport tropical variability through, e.g., coastally trapped waves to the region. Here we investigate the relative contribution of these two mechanisms in the CalCS using a novel setup of the Regional Oceanic Modeling System coupled to a biogeochemical/ecological model. We conducted a hindcast simulation over the period 1979--2013 and contrast the results with those from sensitivity simulations with climatological atmospheric boundary conditions either for the U.S. West Coast or the rest of the Pacific. We find that remote forcing dominates the variability of the physical state in the nearshore region of the CalCS, explaining up to 80\% of monthly mean sea-surface height and temperature variability. In contrast, local processes tend to drive variations in the biogeochemical/ecological state, particularly along central and northern California, explaining up to 50\% of the observed surface variability. Most of the remote forcing is a consequence of coastally trapped waves that travel northward at speeds of approximately 230 km d−1, and thereby alter sea-level height, thermocline structure, and upwelling along California. Biogeochemically active tracers respond to this remote forcing as well, especially at depth, but are more strongly modulated by local atmospheric forcing, especially variations in upwelling-favorable winds.},

Over the past century, the amplitude of this climate pattern has varied irregularly at interannual-to-interdecadal timescales. There is evidence of reversals in the prevailing polarity of the oscillation occurring around 1925, 1947, and 1977; the last two reversals correspond to dramatic shifts in salmon production regimes in the North Pacific Ocean. This climate pattern also affects coastal sea and continental surface air temperatures, as well as streamflow in major west coast river systems, from Alaska to California.},

	Abstract = {Decadal fluctuations in salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll, a variety of zooplankton taxa, and fish stocks in the Northeast Pacific are often poorly correlated with the most widely-used index of large-scale climate variability in the region - the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We define a new pattern of climate change, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) and show that its variability is significantly correlated with previously unexplained fluctuations of salinity, nutrients and chlorophyll. Fluctuations in the NPGO are driven by regional and basin-scale variations in wind-driven upwelling and horizontal advection -- the fundamental processes controlling salinity and nutrient concentrations. Nutrient fluctuations drive concomitant changes in phytoplankton concentrations, and may force similar variability in higher trophic levels. The NPGO thus provides a strong indicator of fluctuations in the mechanisms driving planktonic ecosystem dynamics. The NPGO pattern extends beyond the North Pacific and is part of a global-scale mode of climate variability that is evident in global sea level trends and sea surface temperature. Therefore the amplification of the NPGO variance found in observations and in global warming simulations implies that the NPGO may play an increasingly important role in forcing global-scale decadal changes in marine ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {Long-term timeseries of upper ocean salinity and nutrients collected in the Alaskan Gyre along Line P exhibit significant decadal variations that are shown to be in phase with variations recorded in the Southern California Current System by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation (CalCOFI). We present evidence that these variations are linked to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO)---a climate mode of variability that tracks changes in strength of the central and eastern branches of the North Pacific gyres and of the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE). The NPGO emerges as the leading mode of low-frequency variability for salinity and nutrients. We reconstruct the spatial expressions of the salinity and nutrient modes over the northeast Pacific using a regional ocean model hindcast from 1963-2004. These modes exhibit a large-scale coherent pattern that predicts the in-phase relationship between the Alaskan Gyre and California Current timeseries. The fact that large-amplitude, low-frequency fluctuations in salinity and nutrients are spatially phase-locked and correlated with a measurable climate index (the NPGO) open new avenues for exploring and predicting the effects of long-term climate change on marine ecosystem dynamics.},

@article{Laruelle:2014,
	Abstract = {Over the past decade, estimates of the atmospheric CO2 uptake by continental shelf seas were constrained within the 0.18--0.45 Pg C yr−1 range. However, most of those estimates are based on extrapolations from limited data sets of local flux measurements (n {\textless} 100). Here we propose to derive the CO2 air-sea exchange of the shelf seas by extracting 3 · 106 direct surface ocean CO2 measurements from the global database SOCAT (Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas), atmospheric CO2 values from GlobalVIEW and calculating gas transfer rates using readily available global temperature, salinity, and wind speed fields. We then aggregate our results using a global segmentation of the shelf in 45 units and 152 subunits to establish a consistent regionalized CO2 exchange budget at the global scale. Within each unit, the data density determines the spatial and temporal resolutions at which the air-sea CO2 fluxes are calculated and range from a 0.5$\,^{\circ}$ resolution in the best surveyed regions to a whole unit resolution in areas where data coverage is limited. Our approach also accounts, for the first time, for the partial sea ice cover of polar shelves. Our new regionalized global CO2 sink estimate of 0.19 $\pm$ 0.05 Pg C yr−1 falls in the low end of previous estimates. Reported to an ice-free surface area of 22 · 106 km2, this value yields a flux density of 0.7 mol C m−2 yr−1, {\textasciitilde}40\% more intense than that of the open ocean. Our results also highlight the significant contribution of Arctic shelves to this global CO2 uptake (0.07 Pg C yr−1).},

	Abstract = {The near-term progression of ocean acidification (OA) is projected to bring about sharp changes in the chemistry of coastal upwelling ecosystems. The distribution of OA exposure across these early-impact systems, however, is highly uncertain and limits our understanding of whether and how spatial management actions can be deployed to ameliorate future impacts. Through a novel coastal OA observing network, we have uncovered a remarkably persistent spatial mosaic in the penetration of acidified waters into ecologically-important nearshore habitats across 1,000 km of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. In the most severe exposure hotspots, suboptimal conditions for calcifying organisms encompassed up to 56\% of the summer season, and were accompanied by some of the lowest and most variable pH environments known for the surface ocean. Persistent refuge areas were also found, highlighting new opportunities for local adaptation to address the global challenge of OA in productive coastal systems.},

	Abstract = {Indeed, an early estimate2 from the late 1990s suggested a coastal-ocean sink strength of about 1 petagram of carbon per year (Pg Cyr-1; 1 petagram is 1015g) - a value that, when combined with the open-ocean sink strength3 of about 2.3 $\pm$ 0.7 Pg Cyr-1, would make the ocean by far the largest sink for the CO2 that humans emit every year into the atmosphere3. Reporting in Global Biogeochemical Cycles, Laruelle and coauthors4 now show that the global coastal ocean is a much smaller CO2 sink than was thought, amounting to only about 0.2 Pg Cyr-1.},

	Abstract = {In determining global sea-to-air CO2 flux from measurements or models, the ocean margin has not been resolved from the land or the open ocean. Recent studies have indicated that shelves can be either a large sink or a source for atmospheric CO2. This CO2 sink/source term may substantially alter our current view of the global carbon budget for land and oceans. However, past fieldwork and synthesis have focused on a few shelves in the northern temperate zone while the vast majority of other shelves are ignored. By dividing the highly heterogeneous shelves into seven provinces, we suggest that the continental shelves are a sink for atmospheric CO2 at mid-high latitudes (−0.33 Pg C a−1) and a source of CO2 at low latitudes (0.11 Pg C a−1). Warm temperature and high terrestrial organic carbon input are most likely responsible for the CO2 release in low latitude shelves.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the impact of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on surface wind, sea surface temperature (SST), and surface chlorophyll concentration on intraseasonal to interannual timescales in the Southern Ocean using 8-day average satellite observations. Positive phases of the SAM are associated with enhanced westerly winds over the Antarctic Zone (AZ) and Polar Frontal Zone, driving increased equatorward Ekman transport and cold SST anomalies in these regions. Positive SAM is also associated with easterly wind and warm SST anomalies in the Subtropical Zone. South of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), chlorophyll concentration anomalies are positively correlated with the SAM, however this correlation is negative north of the APF. We suggest that the positive correlation in the AZ is due to the increased supply of iron by upwelling, while the negative correlation north of the APF is caused by stronger light limitation as a consequence of deeper mixed layers.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the interannual variability in the flux of CO2 between the atmosphere and the Southern Ocean on the basis of hindcast simulations with a coupled physical-biogeochemical-ecological model with particular emphasis on the role of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The simulations are run under either pre-industrial or historical CO2 concentrations, permitting us to separately investigate natural, anthropogenic, and contemporary CO2 flux variability. We find large interannual variability ($\pm$0.19 PgC yr−1) in the contemporary air-sea CO2 flux from the Southern Ocean ({\textless}35$\,^{\circ}$S). Forty-three percent of the contemporary air-sea CO2 flux variance is coherent with SAM, mostly driven by variations in the flux of natural CO2, for which SAM explains 48\%. Positive phases of the SAM are associated with anomalous outgassing of natural CO2 at a rate of 0.1 PgC yr−1 per standard deviation of the SAM. In contrast, we find an anomalous uptake of anthropogenic CO2 at a rate of 0.01 PgC yr−1 during positive phases of the SAM. This uptake of anthropogenic CO2 only slightly mitigates the outgassing of natural CO2, so that a positive SAM is associated with anomalous outgassing in contemporaneous times. The primary cause of the natural CO2 outgassing is anomalously high oceanic partial pressures of CO2 caused by elevated dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations. These anomalies in DIC are primarily a result of the circulation changes associated with the southward shift and strengthening of the zonal winds during positive phases of the SAM. The secular, positive trend in the SAM has led to a reduction in the rate of increase of the uptake of CO2 by the Southern Ocean over the past 50 years.},

@article{Takahashi:2002,
	Abstract = {Based on about 940,000 measurements of surface-water pCO2 obtained since the International Geophysical Year of 1956--59, the climatological, monthly distribution of pCO2 in the global surface waters representing mean non-El Ni{\~n}o conditions has been obtained with a spatial resolution of 4$\,^{\circ}$×5$\,^{\circ}$ for a reference year 1995. The monthly and annual net sea--air CO2 flux has been computed using the NCEP/NCAR 41-year mean monthly wind speeds. An annual net uptake flux of CO2 by the global oceans has been estimated to be 2.2 (+22\% or −19\%)Pg Cyr−1 using the (wind speed)2 dependence of the CO2 gas transfer velocity of Wanninkhof (J. Geophys. Res. 97 (1992) 7373). The errors associated with the wind-speed variation have been estimated using one standard deviation (about$\pm$2ms−1) from the mean monthly wind speed observed over each 4$\,^{\circ}$×5$\,^{\circ}$ pixel area of the global oceans. The new global uptake flux obtained with the Wanninkhof (wind speed)2 dependence is compared with those obtained previously using a smaller number of measurements, about 250,000 and 550,000, respectively, and are found to be consistent within$\pm$0.2Pg Cyr−1. This estimate for the global ocean uptake flux is consistent with the values of 2.0$\pm$0.6Pg Cyr−1 estimated on the basis of the observed changes in the atmospheric CO2 and oxygen concentrations during the 1990s (Nature 381 (1996) 218; Science 287 (2000) 2467). However, if the (wind speed)3 dependence of Wanninkhof and McGillis (Res. Lett. 26 (1999) 1889) is used instead, the annual ocean uptake as well as the sensitivity to wind-speed variability is increased by about 70\%. A zone between 40$\,^{\circ}$ and 60$\,^{\circ}$ latitudes in both the northern and southern hemispheres is found to be a major sink for atmospheric CO2. In these areas, poleward-flowing warm waters meet and mix with the cold subpolar waters rich in nutrients. The pCO2 in the surface water is decreased by the cooling effect on warm waters and by the biological drawdown of pCO2 in subpolar waters. High wind speeds over these low pCO2 waters increase the CO2 uptake rate by the ocean waters. The pCO2 in surface waters of the global oceans varies seasonally over a wide range of about 60\% above and below the current atmospheric pCO2 level of about 360μatm. A global map showing the seasonal amplitude of surface-water pCO2 is presented. The effect of biological utilization of CO2 is differentiated from that of seasonal temperature changes using seasonal temperature data. The seasonal amplitude of surface-water pCO2 in high-latitude waters located poleward of about 40$\,^{\circ}$ latitude and in the equatorial zone is dominated by the biology effect, whereas that in the temperate gyre regions is dominated by the temperature effect. These effects are about 6 months out of phase. Accordingly, along the boundaries between these two regimes, they tend to cancel each other, forming a zone of small pCO2 amplitude. In the oligotrophic waters of the northern and southern temperate gyres, the biology effect is about 35μatm on average. This is consistent with the biological export flux estimated by Laws et al. (Glob. Biogeochem. Cycles 14 (2000) 1231). Small areas such as the northwestern Arabian Sea and the eastern equatorial Pacific, where seasonal upwelling occurs, exhibit intense seasonal changes in pCO2 due to the biological drawdown of CO2.
Une distribution climatologique mensuelle moyenne de pCO2 de surface de l'oc{\'e}an mondial a {\'e}t{\'e} {\'e}tablie pour l'ann{\'e}e 1995 (pour les ann{\'e}es sans El Ni{\~n}o) {\`a} partir de 940.000 mesures dans les eaux de surface, acquises depuis l'Ann{\'e}e G{\'e}ophysique Internationale (1956--59), avec une r{\'e}solution spatiale de 4$\,^{\circ}$×5$\,^{\circ}$. Les flux de CO2 air-mer ont {\'e}t{\'e} ensuite calcul{\'e}s, {\`a} l'{\'e}chelle mensuelle et annuelle, en utilisant la distribution des vents mensuels du NCEP/NCAR moyenn{\'e}s sur 41 ans. Le flux net oc{\'e}anique global de CO2 a {\'e}t{\'e} estim{\'e} {\`a} un puits de 2.2 (+22\% ou --19\%) Pg Can−1 en utilisant l'{\'e}quation de Wanninkhof (Geophys. Res. 97 (1992) 7373) dans laquelle le coefficient de transfert (ou la vitesse de piston) du CO2 est exprim{\'e} en fonction du carr{\'e} de la vitesse du vent; les incertitudes associ{\'e}es {\`a} la vitesse du vent ont {\'e}t{\'e} calcul{\'e}es en utilisant une erreur standard de $\pm$2ms−1 pour un vent moyen observ{\'e} sur chaque pixel de 4$\,^{\circ}$×5$\,^{\circ}$ de l'oc{\'e}an global. Le nouveau flux global ainsi calcul{\'e} (carr{\'e} de la vitesse du vent dans le coefficient de transfert) est {\`a} 0.2Pg Can−1 pr{\`e}s, en accord avec nos estimations ant{\'e}rieures bas{\'e}es respectivement sur 250.000 et 550.000 mesures seulement. Ce r{\'e}sultat est {\'e}galement compatible avec les estimations de 2.0$\pm$0.6PgCan−1 de Keeling et al. (Nature 381 (1996) 218) et de Battle et al. (Science 287 (2000) 2467) bas{\'e}es sur la variation des teneurs en CO2 et oxyg{\`e}ne atmosph{\'e}riques pendant la d{\'e}cennie des ann{\'e}es 90. Cependant l'utilisation de l'{\'e}quation de Wanninkhof et McGillis (Res. Lett. 26 (1999) 1889), faisant intervenir le coefficient de transfert de CO2 exprim{\'e} en fonction du cube de la vitesse du vent, donne des valeurs du flux annuel global ainsi que la sensibilit{\'e} {\`a} la variation de la vitesse du vent plus {\'e}lev{\'e}es de 70\%. Le puits majeur de CO2 atmosph{\'e}rique est situ{\'e} dans la bande de latitude comprise entre 40 et 60$\,^{\circ}$ pour les deux h{\'e}misph{\`e}res, o{\`u} les eaux chaudes se dirigeant vers vers le p{\^o}le convergent et se m{\'e}langent avec des eaux froides subpolaires riches en sels nutritifs. La diminution de pCO2 des eaux de surface subpolaires est due {\`a} la fois {\`a} leur refroidissement et {\`a} la pompe biologique. L'intensit{\'e} des vents dans ces r{\'e}gions o{\`u} pCO2 est faible en surface intensifie encore le pompage de CO2. La variation saisonni{\`e}re de pCO2 dans les eaux de surface de l'oc{\'e}an global peut atteindre $\pm$60\% de la valeur actuelle de pCO2 atmosph{\'e}rique moyen (360μatm). Une carte de l'amplitude de la variation saisonni{\`e}re de pCO2 dans les eaux de surface ainsi que l'effet de l'utilisation du CO2 par la production biologique et l'influence de la variation saisonni{\`e}re de la temp{\'e}rature (estim{\'e}e en utilisant des donn{\'e}es saisonni{\`e}res de temp{\'e}rature) sont pr{\'e}sent{\'e}es s{\'e}par{\'e}ment. La variation saisonni{\`e}re de pCO2 des eaux de surface situ{\'e}es entre les p{\^o}les et environ 40$\,^{\circ}$ et celles des r{\'e}gions {\'e}quatoriales est principalement due {\`a} l'effet de la pompe biologique, alors que dans les tourbillons des r{\'e}gions centrales c'est l'effet thermique qui domine, ces deux effets {\'e}tant d{\'e}phas{\'e}s d'environ 6 mois. En cons{\'e}quence, dans les r{\'e}gions fronti{\`e}res de ces deux zones les effets thermique et biologique se compensent, ce qui engendre des variations saisonni{\`e}res de pCO2 de faible amplitude. Dans les eaux oligotrophes des tourbillons centraux des r{\'e}gions temp{\'e}r{\'e}es, l'influence de la biologie est estim{\'e} {\`a} 35μatm en moyenne, ce qui est compatible avec le flux biologique export{\'e} estim{\'e} par Laws et al. (Glob. Biogeochem. Cycles 14 (2000) 1231).

	Abstract = {The North Atlantic is believed to represent the largest ocean sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide in the Northern Hemisphere, yet little is known about its temporal variability. We report an 18-year time series of upper-ocean inorganic carbon observations from the northwestern subtropical North Atlantic near Bermuda that indicates substantial variability in this sink. We deduce that the carbon variability at this site is largely driven by variations in winter mixed-layer depths and by sea surface temperature anomalies. Because these variations tend to occur in a basinwide coordinated pattern associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation, it is plausible that the entire North Atlantic Ocean may vary in concert, resulting in a variability of the strength of the North Atlantic carbon sink of about $\pm$0.3 petagrams of carbon per year (1 petagram = 1015grams) or nearly $\pm$50\%. This extrapolation is supported by basin-wide estimates from atmospheric carbon dioxide inversions.},

	Abstract = {The Atlantic Ocean is one of the most important sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), but this sink has been shown to vary substantially in time. Here we use surface ocean CO2 observations to estimate this sink and the temporal variability from 1998 through 2007 in the Atlantic Ocean. We benefit from (i) a continuous improvement of the observations, i.e. the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) v1.5 database and (ii) a newly developed technique to interpolate the observations in space and time. In particular, we use a two-step neural network approach to reconstruct basin-wide monthly maps of the sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) at a resolution of 1$\,^{\circ}$ × 1$\,^{\circ}$. From those, we compute the air--sea CO2 flux maps using a standard gas exchange parameterization and high-resolution wind speeds. The neural networks fit the observed pCO2 data with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 10 μatm and with almost no bias. A check against independent time-series data and new data from SOCAT v2 reveals a larger RMSE of 22.8 μatm for the entire Atlantic Ocean, which decreases to 16.3 μatm for data south of 40$\,^{\circ}$ N. We estimate a decadal mean uptake flux of −0.45 $\pm$ 0.15 Pg C yr−1 for the Atlantic between 44$\,^{\circ}$ S and 79$\,^{\circ}$ N, representing the sum of a strong uptake north of 18$\,^{\circ}$ N (−0.39 $\pm$ 0.10 Pg C yr−1), outgassing in the tropics (18$\,^{\circ}$ S--18$\,^{\circ}$ N, 0.11 $\pm$ 0.07 Pg C yr−1), and uptake in the subtropical/temperate South Atlantic south of 18$\,^{\circ}$ S (−0.16 $\pm$ 0.06 Pg C yr−1), consistent with recent studies. The strongest seasonal variability of the CO2 flux occurs in the temperature-driven subtropical North Atlantic, with uptake in winter and outgassing in summer. The seasonal cycle is antiphased in the subpolar latitudes relative to the subtropics largely as a result of the biologically driven winter-to-summer drawdown of CO2. Over the 10 yr analysis period (1998 through 2007), sea surface pCO2 increased faster than that of the atmosphere in large areas poleward of 40$\,^{\circ}$ N, while in other regions of the North Atlantic the sea surface pCO2 increased at a slower rate, resulting in a barely changing Atlantic carbon sink north of the Equator (−0.01 $\pm$ 0.02 Pg C yr−1 decade−1). Surface ocean pCO2 increased at a slower rate relative to atmospheric CO2 over most of the Atlantic south of the Equator, leading to a substantial trend toward a stronger CO2 sink for the entire South Atlantic (−0.14 $\pm$ 0.02 Pg C yr−1 decade−1). In contrast to the 10 yr trends, the Atlantic Ocean carbon sink varies relatively little on inter-annual timescales ($\pm$0.04 Pg C yr−1; 1 σ).},

	Abstract = {A climatological mean distribution for the surface water pCO2 over the global oceans in non-El Ni{\~n}o conditions has been constructed with spatial resolution of 4$\,^{\circ}$ (latitude) ×5$\,^{\circ}$ (longitude) for a reference year 2000 based upon about 3 million measurements of surface water pCO2 obtained from 1970 to 2007. The database used for this study is about 3 times larger than the 0.94 million used for our earlier paper [Takahashi et al., 2002. Global sea--air CO2 flux based on climatological surface ocean pCO2, and seasonal biological and temperature effects. Deep-Sea Res. II, 49, 1601--1622]. A time-trend analysis using deseasonalized surface water pCO2 data in portions of the North Atlantic, North and South Pacific and Southern Oceans (which cover about 27\% of the global ocean areas) indicates that the surface water pCO2 over these oceanic areas has increased on average at a mean rate of 1.5μatmy−1 with basin-specific rates varying between 1.2$\pm$0.5 and 2.1$\pm$0.4μatmy−1. A global ocean database for a single reference year 2000 is assembled using this mean rate for correcting observations made in different years to the reference year. The observations made during El Ni{\~n}o periods in the equatorial Pacific and those made in coastal zones are excluded from the database. Seasonal changes in the surface water pCO2 and the sea-air pCO2 difference over four climatic zones in the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Southern Oceans are presented. Over the Southern Ocean seasonal ice zone, the seasonality is complex. Although it cannot be thoroughly documented due to the limited extent of observations, seasonal changes in pCO2 are approximated by using the data for under-ice waters during austral winter and those for the marginal ice and ice-free zones. The net air--sea CO2 flux is estimated using the sea--air pCO2 difference and the air--sea gas transfer rate that is parameterized as a function of (wind speed)2 with a scaling factor of 0.26. This is estimated by inverting the bomb 14C data using Ocean General Circulation models and the 1979--2005 NCEP-DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis (R-2) wind speed data. The equatorial Pacific (14$\,^{\circ}$N--14$\,^{\circ}$S) is the major source for atmospheric CO2, emitting about +0.48Pg-Cy−1, and the temperate oceans between 14$\,^{\circ}$ and 50$\,^{\circ}$ in the both hemispheres are the major sink zones with an uptake flux of −0.70Pg-Cy−1 for the northern and −1.05Pg-Cy−1 for the southern zone. The high-latitude North Atlantic, including the Nordic Seas and portion of the Arctic Sea, is the most intense CO2 sink area on the basis of per unit area, with a mean of −2.5tons-Cmonth−1km−2. This is due to the combination of the low pCO2 in seawater and high gas exchange rates. In the ice-free zone of the Southern Ocean (50$\,^{\circ}$--62$\,^{\circ}$S), the mean annual flux is small (−0.06Pg-Cy−1) because of a cancellation of the summer uptake CO2 flux with the winter release of CO2 caused by deepwater upwelling. The annual mean for the contemporary net CO2 uptake flux over the global oceans is estimated to be −1.6$\pm$0.9Pg-Cy−1, which includes an undersampling correction to the direct estimate of −1.4$\pm$0.7Pg-Cy−1. Taking the pre-industrial steady-state ocean source of 0.4$\pm$0.2Pg-Cy−1 into account, the total ocean uptake flux including the anthropogenic CO2 is estimated to be −2.0$\pm$1.0Pg-Cy−1 in 2000.},

@article{Kay:2015,
	Abstract = { AbstractWhile internal climate variability is known to affect climate projections, its influence is often underappreciated and confused with model error. Why? In general, modeling centers contribute a small number of realizations to international climate model assessments [e.g., phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)]. As a result, model error and internal climate variability are difficult, and at times impossible, to disentangle. In response, the Community Earth System Model (CESM) community designed the CESM Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) with the explicit goal of enabling assessment of climate change in the presence of internal climate variability. All CESM-LE simulations use a single CMIP5 model (CESM with the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5). The core simulations replay the twenty to twenty-first century (1920--2100) 30 times under historical and representative concentration pathway 8.5 external forcing with small initial condition differences. Two companion 1000+-yr-long preindustrial control simulations (fully coupled, prognostic atmosphere and land only) allow assessment of internal climate variability in the absence of climate change. Comprehensive outputs, including many daily fields, are available as single-variable time series on the Earth System Grid for anyone to use. Early results demonstrate the substantial influence of internal climate variability on twentieth- to twenty-first-century climate trajectories. Global warming hiatus decades occur, similar to those recently observed. Internal climate variability alone can produce projection spread comparable to that in CMIP5. Scientists and stakeholders can use CESM-LE outputs to help interpret the observational record, to understand projection spread and to plan for a range of possible futures influenced by both internal climate variability and forced climate change. },

	Abstract = {The 2015--2016 El Ni{\~n}o contributed to large anomalies across the California Current System (CalCS), but these anomalies ceased unexpectedly in late 2015. Here we use a suite of three hindcast simulations with the Regional Oceanic Modeling System to assess the responsible mechanisms for this development. We find that the early buildup was primarily driven by the early onset of this event in the tropical Pacific, driving anomalies in the CalCS through the propagation of coastally trapped waves. In contrast, the abrupt end in the central CalCS was caused by the unusual onset of upwelling favorable winds in the fall of 2015, which offset the continuing remote forcing through the coastal waveguide. Nevertheless, low-nutrient anomalies persisted, causing anomalously low phytoplankton abundance in the upwelling season of 2016. This is a recurring pattern for all El Ni{\~n}o events over the last 37 years, suggesting predictive skill on seasonal timescales.},
