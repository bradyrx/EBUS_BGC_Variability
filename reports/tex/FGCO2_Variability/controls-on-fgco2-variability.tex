\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
\noindent Working to understand what controls historical variability in Sea-Air CO$_{2}$ Flux in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems. I use FG\_CO2 output from the CESM Large Ensemble and correlate it to various climate indices derived from model output.

\section{California Current}

\subsection{Study Site}
For simplicity, I am using the latitudinal bounds set up by \citet{Chavez:2009}. This equates to 34N - 44N for the CCS. In terms of longitude, I want to approach it similarly to \citet{Turi:2014}. In the future, I can make this banded if needed (0-100km, 100-400km, etc.), but for now, 4 regions by 3 bands per region is a lot to work with. Instead, I am just restricting it to 800km offshore and bounded by 10 degrees of latitude for standardization.
