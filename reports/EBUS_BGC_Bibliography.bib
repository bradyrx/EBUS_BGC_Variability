abstract = {Seasonal data for pCO2 and the concentrations of CO2 and nutrients in high-latitude surface oceans obtained by the Lamont-Doherty CO2 group and Marine Research Institute, Reykjavik, are presented and analyzed. The seasonal progression and relationships between these properties are described, and their inter-ocean variation is compared. Spring phytoplankton blooms in the surface water of the North Atlantic Ocean and Iceland Sea caused a precipitous reduction of surface water pCO2 and the concentrations of CO2 and nutrients within two weeks, and proceeded until the nutrient salts were exhausted. This type of seasonal behavior is limited to the high-latitude (north of approximately 40°N) North Atlantic Ocean and adjoining seas. In contrast, seasonal changes in CO2 and nutrients were more gradual in the North Pacific and the nutrients were only partially consumed in the surface waters of the subarctic North Pacific Ocean and Southern Ocean. The magnitude of seasonal changes in nutrient concentrations in the North Pacific and Southern Oceans was similar to that observed in the North Atlantic and adjoining seas. In the subpolar and polar waters of the North and South Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, pCO2 and the concentrations Of CO2 and nutrients were much higher during winter than summer. During winter, the high latitude areas of the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Weddell Sea were sources for atmospheric CO2; during summer, they became CO2 sinks. This is attributed to the upwelling of deep waters rich in CO2 and nutrients during winter, and the intense photosynthesis occurring in strongly stratified upper layers during summer. On the other hand, subtropical waters were a CO2 source in summer and a sink in winter. Since these waters were depleted of nutrients and could only sustain low levels of primary production, the seasonal variation of pCO2 in subtropical waters and the CO2 sink/source condition were governed primarily by temperature. An intense CO2 sink zone was found along the confluence of the subtropical and subpolar waters (or the subtropical convergence). Its formation is attributed to the combined effects of cooling in subtropical waters and photosynthetic drawdown of CO2 in subpolar waters.},

abstract = {Ocean carbon uptake substantially reduces the rate of anthropogenic carbon accumulation in the atmosphere and thus slows global climate change. In the interest of understanding how this ocean carbon sink has responded to climate variability and climate change in recent decades, trends in globally observed surface ocean partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2 s.ocean) are evaluated over 16 gyre-scale biomes covering the globe. Trends from decadal to multidecadal timescales between 1981 and 2010 are considered. On decadal timescales, pCO2 s.ocean trends have been of variable magnitude and sensitive to the chosen start and end years. On longer time frames, several regions of the tropics and subtropics display pCO2 s.ocean trends that are parallel to or shallower than trends in atmospheric pCO2, consistent with the ocean's long-term response to carbon accumulation in the atmosphere and with the supply of waters with low anthropogenic carbon from the deep ocean. Data are too sparse in the high latitudes to determine this long-term response. In many biomes, pCO2 s.ocean trends steeper than atmospheric trends do occur on shorter timescales, which is consistent with forcing by climatic variability. In the Southern Ocean, the influence of a positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode has waned and the carbon sink has strengthened since the early 2000s. In North Atlantic subtropical and equatorial biomes, warming has become a significant and persistent contributor to the observed increase in pCO2 s.ocean since the mid-2000s. This long-term warming, previously attributed to both multidecadal climate variability and anthropogenic forcing, is beginning to reduce ocean carbon uptake. Citation:},

We report an 18-year time series of upper-ocean inorganic carbon observations from the northwestern subtropical North Atlantic near Bermuda that indicates substantial variability in this sink. We deduce that the carbon variability at this site is largely driven by variations in winter mixed-layer depths and by sea surface temperature anomalies. Because these variations tend to occur in a basinwide coordinated pattern associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation, it is plausible that the entire North Atlantic Ocean may vary in concert, resulting in a variability of the strength of the North Atlantic carbon sink of about +/-0.3 petagrams of carbon per year (1 petagram=10(15) grams) or nearly +/-50{\%}. This extrapolation is supported by basin-wide estimates from atmospheric carbon dioxide inversions.},

The simulation is run with a prescribed, pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 concentration for 1000 years, permitting investigation of natural [CO32−] variability on interannual to multi-decadal timescales. We find high interannual variability in surface [CO32−] in the tropical Pacific and at the boundaries between the subtropical and subpolar gyres in the Northern Hemisphere, and relatively low interannual variability in the centers of the subtropical gyres and in the Southern Ocean. Statistical analysis of modeled [CO32−] variance and autocorrelation suggests that significant anthropogenic trends in the saturation state of aragonite ($\Omega$aragonite) are already or nearly detectable at the sustained, open-ocean time series sites, whereas several decades of observations are required to detect anthropogenic trends in $\Omega$aragonite in the tropical Pacific, North Pacific, and North Atlantic. The detection timescale for anthropogenic trends in pH is shorter than that for $\Omega$aragonite, due to smaller noise-to-signal ratios and lower autocorrelation in pH. In the tropical Pacific, the leading mode of surface [CO32−] variability is primarily driven by variations in the vertical advection of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in association with El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation. In the North Pacific, surface [CO32−] variability is caused by circulation-driven variations in surface DIC and strongly correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, with peak spectral power at 20–30-year periods. North Atlantic [CO32−] variability is also driven by variations in surface DIC, and exhibits weak correlations with both the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. As the scientific community seeks to detect the anthropogenic influence on ocean carbonate chemistry, these results will aid the interpretation of trends calculated from spatially and temporally sparse observations.},

During normal conditions, both Ekman suction and offshore Ekman transport produced upwelling. During the El Nino, the May-August speed of Ekman pumping (-9 x 10(-6) m s(-1)) was nearly 4 times larger than the normal speed of Ekman suction and offshore Ekman transport nearly doubled.

abstract = {The California Current System (CCS) is forced by the distribution of atmospheric pressure and associated winds in relation to the west coast of North America. In this paper, we begin with a simplified case of winds and a linear coast, then consider variability characteristic of the CCS, and conclude by considering future change. The CCS extends from the North Pacific Current (∼50°N) to off Baja California, Mexico (∼15-25°N) with a major discontinuity at Point Conception (34.5°N). Variation in atmospheric pressure affects winds and thus upwelling. Coastal, wind-driven upwelling results in nutrification and biological production and a southward coastal jet. Offshore, curl-driven upwelling results in a spatially large, productive habitat. The California Current flows equatorward and derives from the North Pacific Current and the coastal jet. Dominant modes of spatial and temporal variability in physical processes and biological responses are discussed. High surface production results in deep and bottom waters depleted in oxygen and enriched in carbon dioxide. Fishing has depleted demersal stocks more than pelagic stocks, and marine mammals, including whales, are recovering. Krill, squid, and micronekton are poorly known and merit study. Future climate change will differ from past change and thus prediction of the CCS requires an understanding of its dynamics. Of particular concern are changes in winds, stratification, and ocean chemistry. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The calculation is made from the coast to 150 km offshore and the wind-driven upwelling is partitioned into that contributed by Ekman transport and pumping. We assume that on the upwelling event time scale (days) the water brought to the surface originates from a depth of 60 m. Seasonal climatologies are used to estimate in situ nitrate concentration at 60 m, and nitrate supply is calculated as the product of nitrate concentration times the vertical transport obtained from QuikSCAT. This represents the potential new production, i.e. the amount of nitrate available for phytoplankton primary production, for each region. We find that Benguela, Northwest Africa and Peru have similar levels of nitrate supply and potential new production while California has about 60{\%} of the other three. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Atlantic Ocean is one of the most important sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), but this sink has been shown to vary substantially in time. Here we use surface ocean CO2 observations to estimate this sink and the temporal variability from 1998 through 2007 in the Atlantic Ocean. We benefit from (i) a continuous improvement of the observations, i.e. the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) v1.5 database and (ii) a newly developed technique to interpolate the observations in space and time. In particular, we use a two-step neural network approach to reconstruct basin-wide monthly maps of the sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) at a resolution of 1 ×1. From those, we compute the air–sea CO2 flux maps using a standard gas exchange parameterization and high-resolution wind speeds. The neural networks fit the observed pCO2 data with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 10 $\mu$atm and with almost no bias. A check against independent time-series data and new data from SOCAT v2 reveals a larger RMSE of 22.8 $\mu$atm for the entire Atlantic Ocean, which decreases to 16.3 $\mu$atm for data south of 40 N. We estimate a decadal mean uptake flux of −0.45±0.15 PgC yr−1 for the Atlantic between 44 S and 79 N, representing the sum of a strong uptake north of 18 N (−0.39±0.10 PgC yr−1), outgassing in the tropics (18 S–18 N, 0.11±0.07 PgC yr−1), and uptake in the subtropical/temperate South Atlantic south of 18 S (−0.16±0.06 PgC yr−1), consistent with recent studies. The strongest seasonal variability of the CO2 flux occurs in the temperature-driven subtropical North Atlantic, with uptake in winter and outgassing in summer. The seasonal cycle is antiphased in the subpolar latitudes relative to the subtropics largely as a result of the biologically driven winter-to-summer drawdown of CO2. Over the 10 yr analysis period (1998 through 2007), sea surface pCO2 increased faster than that of the atmosphere in large areas poleward of 40 N, while in other regions of the North Atlantic the sea surface pCO2 increased at a slower rate, resulting in a barely changing Atlantic carbon sink north of the Equator (−0.01±0.02 PgC yr−1 decade−1). Surface ocean pCO2 increased at a slower rate relative to atmospheric CO2 over most of the Atlantic south of the Equator, leading to a substantial trend toward a stronger CO2 sink for the entire South Atlantic (−0.14±0.02 PgC yr−1 decade−1). In contrast to the 10 yr trends, the Atlantic Ocean carbon sink varies relatively little on inter-annual timescales (±0.04 PgC yr−1; 1).},

abstract = {In spite of the recent strong increase in the number of measurements of the partial pressure of CO2 in the surface ocean (pCO2), the air-sea CO2 balance of the continental shelf seas remains poorly quantified. This is a consequence of these regions remaining strongly under-sampled both in time and space, and of surface pCO2 exhibiting much higher temporal and spatial variability in these regions compared to the open ocean. Here, we use a modified version of a two-step artificial neural network method (SOM-FFN, Landsch{\"{u}}tzer et al., 2013) to interpolate the pCO2 data along the continental margins with a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees and with monthly resolution from 1998 until 2014. The most important modifications compared to the original SOM-FFN method are (i) the much higher spatial resolution, and (ii) the inclusion of sea-ice as a predictor of pCO2. The validity of our interpolation, both in space and time, is assessed by comparing the SOM-FFN outputs with pCO2 measurements extracted from the SOCATv3.0 and LDVEO2014 datasets. The new coastal pCO2 product confirms a previously suggested general meridional trend of the annual mean pCO2 in all the continental shelves with high values in the tropics and dropping to values beneath those of the atmosphere at higher latitudes. But significant differences in the seasonality across the ocean basins exist. The shelves of the western and northern Pacific, as well as the shelves in the temperate North Atlantic display particularly pronounced seasonal variations in pCO2, while the shelves in the southeastern Atlantic and in the South Pacific reveal a much smaller seasonality. Overall, the seasonality in shelf pCO2 cannot solely be explained by temperature-induced changes in solubility, but are also the result of seasonal changes in circulation, mixing, and biological productivity. Finally, thanks to this product having been extended to cover open ocean areas as well, it can be readily merged with existing global open ocean products to produce a true global perspective of the spatial and temporal variability of surface ocean pCO2.},

This cross-shore pattern shows up as the primary mode of variability in central and northern CCS vertical velocity anomalies, accounting for ∼40{\%} of the total variance.

Prelude: Stronger-than-average easterlies for 18 months, piling warm waters to the east and creating a larger-than-normal west-east SSH gradient. The thermocline in the west is now deeper than average.

Onset: In the fall preceding the El Nino event, there is a warm pool out east now. The trade winds begin to relax, as done the sea level slope.},

abstract = {The Benguela system is one of the four major eastern boundary upwelling systems of the world. It is unusual as there are two stratified subtropical or warm temperate boundary regions, on either side of the major wind-driven upwelling region(19-34??S), which itself is subdivided at 26??S by the powerful Luderitz upwelling cell. Important biological components cross the boundary areas at different stages to complete the life-history cycle. While the "Bakun triad" of factors responsible for the development of large pelagic fish populations (enrichment, concentration and retention) provide an important unifying principle for understanding the compromise implicit in adaptation to upwelling systems, the role of predation has been neglected, as has the fish yield relative to photosynthesis. The role global climate change will have in the Benguela in terms of shifting boundaries or weakening or intensifying gradients is being explored. The interannual and decadal signals are so strong in the region that long term trends are difficult to distinguish. Intensive resource utilisation and the collapse of several fish stocks occurred in the Benguela region during the 1960s and 1970s, with different recovery trajectories in the north and the south. The Angolan subsystem can be described as a subtropical transition zone between the wind-driven upwelling system and the Equatorial Atlantic, with gentle upwelling-favourable winds, well-defined seasons, intermediate productivity and moderate, declining fisheries. It is separated from the Namibian subsystem by the Angola-Benguela front. The northern Benguela shelf is a typical coastal upwelling system with equatorward winds, cool water, high plankton biomass and moderate to high fish biomass, which is currently in a depleted state. A shift from sardines to horse mackerel occurred during the period 1970-1990, while hake have never fully recovered from intensive fishing pressure up to 1990. Widespread oxygen-depleted waters and sulphur eruptions result from local and remote forcing, restricting the habitat available for pelagic and demersal fish species. The Luderitz-Orange River Cone is an intensive perennial upwelling cell where strong winds, high turbulence and strong offshore transport constitute a partial barrier to epipelagic fish species. Upwelling source water alters in salinity and oxygen, across this boundary zone. A decline in upwelling-favourable winds occurred between 1990 and 2005. The southern Benguela region is characterised by a pulsed, seasonal, wind-driven upwelling at discrete centres and warm Agulhas water offshore. High primary productivity forms a belt of enrichment along the coast, constrained by a front. Low-oxygen water, which only occurs close inshore, may adversely affect some resources. The west coast is primarily a nursery ground for several fish species which spawn on the Agulhas Bank and are transported by alongshore jet currents to the west coast. The Agulhas Bank forms the southern boundary of the Benguela system and it displays characteristics of both an upwelling and a temperate shallow shelf system, with seasonal stratification and mixing, coastal, shelf-edge and dynamic upwelling, moderate productivity and a well oxygenated shelf. A large biomass of fish occupies the Bank during the summer season, with some evidence for tight coupling between trophic levels. A cool ridge of upwelled water, with links to coastal upwelling and to the Agulhas Current, appears to play an important but poorly understood role affecting the distribution and productivity of pelagic fish. A boom in sardine and anchovy populations was accompanied by an eastward shift, followed by 5 years of poor recruitment by sardine but successful recruitment of anchovy, indicating changes in the early life-history patterns of these two species. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Five years of SeaWiFS ocean color data are used to characterize the variability of surface chlorophyll (SCHL) over seasonal and intraseasonal timescales along the northwest African coast (between 10°N and 33°N). This variability is interpreted in regards of remotely sensed wind stress and sea surface temperature and of climatological surface nitrate concentration. Three regions with fairly different behaviors are identified: the region of the subtropical gyre (24°N–33°N) is characterized by a weak seasonality and chlorophyll confined at the coast. The inter-gyre region off Cape Blanc (19°N–24°N) is characterized by a weak seasonality and a persistent large offshore extension of chlorophyll. The region of the recirculation gyre (10°N–19°N) is characterized by a strong seasonality and a large offshore extension of chlorophyll from February to May followed by an abrupt chlorophyll drop that propagates northward from May to June. The seasonal variability is well explained by the seasonal variability in wind-forcing. Nutrient limitation is the key factor that explains the weak offshore extension of chlorophyll in the North. The chlorophyll drop in the South is attributed to the weakening of the wind-forcing and the simultaneous advection of warm water from the South by a coastal and seasonal branch of the North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC). Intraseasonal variability is present in all regions. The cases of good correlation between the intraseasonal variability of the chlorophyll and of the wind-forcing are found to be associated with weak chlorophyll offshore extension and large nutrient limitation.},

abstract = {Upwelling of nutrient-rich, subsurface water sustains high productivity in the ocean's eastern boundary currents. These ecosystems support a rate of fish harvest nearly 100 times the global mean and account for {\textgreater}20{\%} of the world's marine fish catch. Environmental variability is thought to be the major cause of the decadal-scale biomass fluctuations characteristic of fish populations in these regions, but the mechanisms relating atmospheric physics to fish production remain unexplained. Two atmospheric conditions induce different types of upwelling in these ecosystems: coastal, alongshore wind stress, resulting in rapid upwelling (with high vertical velocity, w); and wind-stress curl, resulting in slower upwelling (low w). We show that the level of wind-stress curl has increased and that production of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) varies with wind-stress curl over the past six decades. The extent of isopycnal shoaling, nutricline depth, and chlorophyll concentration in the upper ocean also correlate positively with wind-stress curl. The size structure of plankton assemblages is related to the rate of wind-forced upwelling, and sardine feed efficiently on small plankters generated by slow upwelling. Upwelling rate is a fundamental determinant of the biological structure and production in coastal pelagic ecosystems, and future changes in the magnitude and spatial gradient of wind stress may have important and differing effects on these ecosystems. Understanding of the biological mechanisms relating fisheries production to environmental variability is essential for wise management of marine resources under a changing climate.},

abstract = {Coastal upwelling along eastern boundaries has fascinated oceanographers for decades. The strong coupling between atmospheric forcing, ocean circulation, biogeochemical cycling, and food web dynamics encouraged oceanographers to conduct multidisciplinary scientific studies that have since become common. Following that tradition, an interdisciplinary approach is taken to highlight differences between the major Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems (EBUE's). Ocean basin-scale settings are important determinants of EBUE characteristics. First, trade winds accumulate heat and mass in the western side of the basins, deepening the thermocline in the west and raising it in the east. Second, and especially prominent in the Pacific, these properties are redistributed eastwards on interannual and multidecadal time scales, reducing the characteristically high biological productivity found in the eastern basin margins. Thirdly, north-south patterns of thermocline doming on the equator and deepening in the subtropical gyres, and high latitude weather-driven mixing makes latitude an important characteristic of each EBUE. As such each EBUE has 3-4 well-defined latitudinally distributed biomes. Many enigmas remain regarding EBUE's including: (1) Why do EBUE's differ dramatically in fish but not in primary production? (2) What nutrients or other physical properties limit EBUE primary production? (3) What roles do subsurface oxygen minimum zones play in EBUE ecosystems? (4) What role do euphausiids play in the transfer of energy through EBUE food webs? (5) What are the roles of EBUE food webs in the biogeochemical cycling of elements? (6) How inter-connected are biomes of EBUE ecosystems? and (7) Most importantly for society, how will EBUE's respond to climate and global change. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Recent observations indicate that the CanC region as a whole has been experiencing a progressive warming and a decrease in productivity over the last decades. This overall trend is however not directly reflected in the fisheries of the region. Here we update recent results and previous reviews on the CanC, covering aspects from the physical environment to fish populations and fisheries on a range of time scales. We approach these topics, when possible, through a comparative exploration of the biogeographical characteristics of different sub-regions comprising this ecosystem. This review shows that variability in coastline configuration, shelf width, coastal upwelling, nutrient fertilization, productivity, or retentive vs. dispersive physical mechanisms, among other factors, may help explain sub-regional differences in fish distributions and abundances in the CanC. Nevertheless, the lack of systematic information on the regional variability of physical and biological processes hampers an integrated understanding of the relative contribution of natural vs. human-induced variability in the populations of at least small-pelagic fishes and their associated fisheries. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {For the detection of climate change, not only the magnitude of a trend signal is of significance. An essential issue is the time period required by the trend to be detectable in the first place. An illustrative measure for this is time of emergence (ToE), that is, the point in time when a signal finally emerges from the background noise of natural variability. We investigate the ToE of trend signals in different biogeochemical and physical surface variables utilizing a multi-model ensemble comprising simulations of 17 Earth system models (ESMs). We find that signals in ocean biogeochemical variables emerge on much shorter timescales than the physical variable sea surface temperature (SST). The ToE patterns of pCO2 and pH are spatially very similar to DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon), yet the trends emerge much faster – after roughly 12 yr for the majority of the global ocean area, compared to between 10 and 30 yr for DIC. ToE of 45–90 yr are even larger for SST. In general, the background noise is of higher importance in determining ToE than the strength of the trend signal. In areas with high natural variability, even strong trends both in the physical climate and carbon cycle system are masked by variability over decadal timescales. In contrast to the trend, natural variability is affected by the seasonal cycle. This has important implications for observations, since it implies that intra-annual variability could question the representativeness of irregularly sampled seasonal measurements for the entire year and, thus, the interpretation of observed trends.},

abstract = {The tropical ocean off the west coast of South America is nota- ble for several reasons. First, it is unusually cool for an ocean that is so close to the equator with sea surface temperatures at 5 ?S off Peru as cool as 16 ?C when most other tropical locations are in ex- cess of 25 ?C. Upwelling of cool waters brings phytoplankton nutri- ents to the surface, dramatically increasing biological productivity in this low-latitude region of few storms. Second, as a result of the enhanced productivity, the northern Humboldt Current System (HCS) off Peru produces more fish per unit area than any other re- gion in the world oceans (Fig. 1), representing less than 0.1{\%} of the world ocean surface but presently producing about 10{\%} of the world fish catch. Third, as a result of sinking and decay of sur- face-derived primary production and poor ventilation, surface oxy- genated waters overlie an intense and extremely shallow Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ). The OMZ forms a barrier to some animals, concentrating living resources near the surface. At the other end of the spectrum different forms of marine life have adapted to this harsh environment, some utilizing it as a refuge from predation. The OMZ also affects global nutrient budgets, as nitrate instead of oxygen is used by bacteria as a terminal electron acceptor. Fourth, beneath the OMZ, in layered continental shelf sediments the absence of oxygen preserves dead organisms, creating a record of past ecosystem and climate changes. Fifth, through ocean/atmo- sphere coupling, the northern HCS is intimately linked to equato- rial Pacific dynamics and is subject to large interannual to multidecadal fluctuations in climate, ecosystems and its fisheries.},

abstract = {In the Humboldt Current System (HCS), biological and non-biological components, ecosystem processes, and fisheries are known to be affected by multi-decadal, inter-annual, annual, and intra-seasonal scales. The interplay between atmospheric variability, the poleward undercurrent, the shallow oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), and the fertilizing effect of coastal upwelling and overall high primary production rates drive bio-physical interactions, the carbon biomass, and fluxes of gases and particulate and dissolved matter through the water column. Coastal upwelling (permanent and seasonally modulated off Peru and northern Chile, and markedly seasonal between 30??S and 40??S) is the key process responsible for the high biological productivity in the HCS. At present, the western coast of South America produces more fish per unit area than any other region in the world ocean (i.e. ???7.5 ?? 10
                        6 t of anchoveta were landed in 2007). Climate changes on different temporal scales lead to alterations in the distribution ranges of anchoveta and sardine populations and shifts in their dominance throughout the HCS. The factors affecting the coastal marine ecosystem that reverberate in the fisheries are crucial from a social perspective, since the economic consequences of mismanagement can be severe. Fish remains are often well-preserved in sediment settings under the hypoxic conditions of the OMZ off Peru and Chile, and reveal multi-decadal variability and centennial-scale changes in fish populations. Sediment studies from the Chilean continental margin encompassing the last 20,000 years of deposition reveal changes in sub-surface conditions in the HCS during deglaciation, interpreted to include: a major reorganization of the OMZ; a deglacial increase in denitrification decoupled from local marine productivity; and higher deglacial and Holocene paleoproductivities compared to the Last Glacial Maximum in central-south Chile (35-37??S) while this scheme is reversed for north-central Chile. Multi-scale, interdisciplinary approaches and focused research groups are needed to understand air-sea interactions, plankton dynamics, biomass removal by fisheries, and the transformation and fluxes of matter across the different HCS components. In this paper, we present a multidisciplinary synthesis of the HCS that covers its physics, atmosphere, primary and secondary production, medium and high trophic levels, fisheries including management aspects, and relevant sedimentary studies. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
