@article{jacox_spatially_2014,
	Abstract = {A historical analysis of California Current System (CCS) circulation, performed using the Regional Ocean Modeling System with four-dimensional variational data assimilation, was used to study upwelling variability during the 1988--2010 period. We examined upwelling directly from the vertical velocity field, which elucidates important temporal and spatial variability not captured by traditional coastal upwelling indices. Through much of the CCS, upwelling within 50 km of the coast has increased, as reported elsewhere. However, from 50 to 200 km offshore, upwelling trends are negative and interannual variability is 180$\,^{\circ}$ out of phase with the nearshore signal. This cross-shore pattern shows up as the primary mode of variability in central and northern CCS vertical velocity anomalies, accounting for ∼40\% of the total variance. Corresponding time series of the dominant modes in the central and northern CCS are strongly correlated with large-scale climate indices, suggesting that climate fluctuations may alternately favor different biological communities.},

@article{brady_emergent_2017,
	Abstract = {Upwelling in the California Current System (CCS) sustains a productive ecosystem and is mediated by alongshore, equatorward wind stress. A decades-old hypothesis proposes that global warming will accelerate these upwelling favorable winds. Recent analyses provide empirical support for upwelling intensification in the poleward portion of the CCS. However, these studies rely on proxies for upwelling and are limited in their ability to distinguish anthropogenic forcing from internal climate variability. Here we estimate simulated changes in CCS upwelling from 1920 to 2100 using monthly output from a single climate model ensemble, where divergences among simulations can be attributed entirely to internal climate variability. Our projections suggest that CCS upwelling will become more intense in the spring and less intense in the summer as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Anthropogenic changes in upwelling will emerge primarily in the second half of the century.},

@article{alexander_atmospheric_2002,
	Abstract = {During El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, the atmospheric response to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the equatorial Pacific influences ocean conditions over the remainder of the globe. This connection between ocean basins via the ``atmospheric bridge'' is reviewed through an examination of previous work augmented by analyses of 50 years of data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction--National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP--NCAR) reanalysis project and coupled atmospheric general circulation (AGCM)--mixed layer ocean model experiments. Observational and modeling studies have now established a clear link between SST anomalies in the equatorial Pacific with those in the North Pacific, north tropical Atlantic, and Indian Oceans in boreal winter and spring. ENSO-related SST anomalies also appear to be robust in the western North Pacific during summer and in the Indian Ocean during fall. While surface heat fluxes are the key component of the atmospheric bridge driving SST anomalies, Ekman transport also creates SST anomalies in the central North Pacific although the full extent of its impact requires further study. The atmospheric bridge not only influences SSTs on interannual timescales but also affects mixed layer depth (MLD), salinity, the seasonal evolution of upper-ocean temperatures, and North Pacific SST variability at lower frequencies. The model results indicate that a significant fraction of the dominant pattern of low-frequency ({\textgreater}10 yr) SST variability in the North Pacific is associated with tropical forcing. AGCM experiments suggest that the oceanic feedback on the extratropical response to ENSO is complex, but of modest amplitude. Atmosphere--ocean coupling outside of the tropical Pacific slightly modifies the atmospheric circulation anomalies in the Pacific--North America (PNA) region but these modifications appear to depend on the seasonal cycle and air--sea interactions both within and beyond the North Pacific Ocean.},

@article{aristegui_sub-regional_2009,
	Abstract = {The Canary Current upwelling ecosystem (CanC) constitutes one of the four main eastern boundary upwelling ecosystems (EBUEs) of the world, thus hosting high productivity and fisheries. Recent observations indicate that the CanC region as a whole has been experiencing a progressive warming and a decrease in productivity over the last decades. This overall trend is however not directly reflected in the fisheries of the region. Here we update recent results and previous reviews on the CanC, covering aspects from the physical environment to fish populations and fisheries on a range of time scales. We approach these topics, when possible, through a comparative exploration of the biogeographical characteristics of different sub-regions comprising this ecosystem. This review shows that variability in coastline configuration, shelf width, coastal upwelling, nutrient fertilization, productivity, or retentive vs. dispersive physical mechanisms, among other factors, may help explain sub-regional differences in fish distributions and abundances in the CanC. Nevertheless, the lack of systematic information on the regional variability of physical and biological processes hampers an integrated understanding of the relative contribution of natural vs. human-induced variability in the populations of at least small-pelagic fishes and their associated fisheries.},

@article{bakun_greenhouse_2010,
	Abstract = {Coastal ocean upwelling ecosystems generally represent the most productive large marine ecosystems of the world's oceans, in terms of both primary production rates and tonnages of exploitable fish produced. The Peruvian upwelling system, in particular, stands out as a major factor in world fish production. The Pacific trade winds have traditionally been considered to be the primary driving force for the upwelling system off Peru, but are projected to weaken as climate change proceeds. This leads to concern that the upwelling process in the Peru system, to which its productivity is linked, may likewise weaken. However, other mechanisms involving greenhouse-associated intensification of thermal low-pressure cells over the coastal landmasses of upwelling regions suggest general intensification of wind-driven ocean upwelling in coastal upwelling regions of the world's oceans. But although certain empirical results have supported this expectation, it has not been consistently corroborated in climate model simulations, possibly because the scale of the coastal intensification may be small relative to the scales that are appropriately reflected in the standard models. Here we summarize available evidence for the intensification mechanism and present a proxy test that uses variations in water vapor, the dominant natural greenhouse gas, to offer multiple-realization empirical evidence for action of the proposed mechanism in the real world situation. While many potential consequences to the future of marine ecosystems would codepend on climate change-related changes in the thermocline and nutricline structures, an important subset, involving potential increased propensities for hypoxia, noxious gas eruptions, toxic red tide blooms, and/or jellyfish outbreaks, may depend more directly on changes in the upwelling-favorable wind itself. A prospective role of fisheries in either mitigating or reinforcing this particular class of effects is suggested.},

@article{bakun_seasonal_1991,
	Abstract = {Historical surface marine wind reports have been processed to define characteristic seasonal distributions of wind-stress curl over the four major eastern boundary current regions of the World Ocean (i.e., the California, Canary, Benguela, and Peru/Humboldt systems) on smaller scales than previously available. Interregional comparisons show that these ``classical'' coastal upwelling systems are characterized by cyclonic wind-stress curl near the continental boundaries and anticyclonic curl offshore, in association with predominantly equatorward (upwelling favorable) alongshore wind stress. The cross-shore profile of alongshore stress typically has an offshore maximum located some 200 to 300 km from the coast. The decay of the wind stress toward the coast defines a region of cyclonic wind-stress curl, where coastal upwelling is enhanced by curl-induced oceanic upwelling (Ekman pumping). During summer in the respective hemispheres, the region of cyclonic curl expands poleward in each boundary current system. Particularly intense cyclonic curl occurs adjacent to capes during summer coastal upwelling maxima. During fall and winter when the upwelling system weakens, the latitudinal extent of cyclonic curl adjacent to the coast contracts, and the moist intense cyclonic curl is usually associated with coastal bights.},

@article{bednarsek_limacina_2014,
	Abstract = {Few studies to date have demonstrated widespread biological impacts of ocean acidification (OA) under conditions currently found in the natural environment. From a combined survey of physical and chemical water properties and biological sampling along the Washington--Oregon--California coast in August 2011, we show that large portions of the shelf waters are corrosive to pteropods in the natural environment. We show a strong positive correlation between the proportion of pteropod individuals with severe shell dissolution damage and the percentage of undersaturated water in the top 100 m with respect to aragonite. We found 53\% of onshore individuals and 24\% of offshore individuals on average to have severe dissolution damage. Relative to pre-industrial CO2 concentrations, the extent of undersaturated waters in the top 100 m of the water column has increased over sixfold along the California Current Ecosystem (CCE). We estimate that the incidence of severe pteropod shell dissolution owing to anthropogenic OA has doubled in near shore habitats since pre-industrial conditions across this region and is on track to triple by 2050. These results demonstrate that habitat suitability for pteropods in the coastal CCE is declining. The observed impacts represent a baseline for future observations towards understanding broader scale OA effects.},

@article{black_winter_2011,
	Abstract = {Analysis of monthly coastal upwelling intensities revealed two seasonal and biologically relevant upwelling `modes' in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE). The first mode reflected upwelling during the summer months and was characterized by low-frequency (multidecadal) processes, including significant (P{\textless}0.01) linear trends at some latitudes. In contrast, the second mode reflected wintertime upwelling and was defined by higher-frequency variability associated with the North Pacific High and El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation events. These modes were compared with multidecadal time series of splitnose rockfish (Sebastes diploproa) otolith growth, yelloweye rockfish (S. ruberrimus) otolith growth, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) scale growth, and indices of Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and common murre (Uria aalge) reproduction in the central-northern CCE. In redundancy and correlation analyses, salmon growth and Cassin's auklet fledgling success associated with the summer upwelling mode while all other time series associated with the winter upwelling mode, indicating that CCE biology was differentially sensitive to these seasonal upwelling patterns. Thus, upwelling occurred in unrelated seasonal modes with contrasting trends, atmospheric forcing mechanisms, and impacts on the biology of the CCE, underscoring the importance of seasonality when evaluating ecosystem response to climate variability and change.},

Phenology plays a particularly critical role in eastern boundary ecosystems, which are driven largely by the seasonal cycle of coastal upwelling. Here we develop and describe a set of indicators that quantify the timing, evolution, intensity, and duration of coastal upwelling in the California Current large marine ecosystem (CCLME). There is significant interannual variability in upwelling characteristics during 1967--2007, with extended periods of high (1970s, 1998--2004) and low (1980--1995) seasonally-integrated upwelling and a trend towards a later and shorter upwelling season in the northern CCLME. El Ni{\~n}o years were characterized by delayed and weak upwelling in the central CCLME. Understanding the causes and ecosystem consequences of phenological changes in coastal upwelling is critical, as climate models project significant variability in the amplitude and phase of coastal upwelling under varying climate change scenarios.},

	Abstract = {Although many marine organisms have life histories adapted to seasonal events in the environment, most studies aimed at understanding biotic responses to environmental variability assume a stationary and deterministic seasonal cycle, or remove it altogether. Here we use historical sea level pressure data for the period 1948--2000 to document significant changes in the amplitude and phase of the seasonal cycle in the Aleutian Low and North Pacific High, the two dominant pressure centers over the northeast Pacific Ocean. The Aleutian Low seasonal amplitude, which is dominated by the annual component, has nearly doubled over this period, mostly due to wintertime deepening. Changes in the amplitude and phase of both the annual and semi-annual components have contributed to the time-varying structure of the North Pacific High. Observed long-term changes in the biological community structure and productivity of the North Pacific Ocean may be associated with this changing seasonality.},

@article{di_lorenzo_nutrient_2009,
	Abstract = {Long-term timeseries of upper ocean salinity and nutrients collected in the Alaskan Gyre along Line P exhibit significant decadal variations that are shown to be in phase with variations recorded in the Southern California Current System by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation (CalCOFI). We present evidence that these variations are linked to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO)---a climate mode of variability that tracks changes in strength of the central and eastern branches of the North Pacific gyres and of the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE). The NPGO emerges as the leading mode of low-frequency variability for salinity and nutrients. We reconstruct the spatial expressions of the salinity and nutrient modes over the northeast Pacific using a regional ocean model hindcast from 1963-2004. These modes exhibit a large-scale coherent pattern that predicts the in-phase relationship between the Alaskan Gyre and California Current timeseries. The fact that large-amplitude, low-frequency fluctuations in salinity and nutrients are spatially phase-locked and correlated with a measurable climate index (the NPGO) open new avenues for exploring and predicting the effects of long-term climate change on marine ecosystem dynamics.},

@article{sutton_natural_2014,
	Abstract = {The equatorial Pacific is a dynamic region that plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. This region is the largest oceanic source of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere, which varies interannually dependent on the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and other climatic and oceanic drivers. We present high-resolution observations of surface ocean CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) at four fixed locations in the Ni{\~n}o 3.4 area with data sets encompassing 10 ENSO warm and cold events from 1997 to 2011. The mooring observations confirm that ENSO controls much of the interannual variability in surface seawater pCO2 with values ranging from 315 to 578 µatm. The mooring time series also capture the temporal variability necessary to make the first estimates of long-term pH trends in the equatorial Pacific, which suggests that the combination of ocean acidification and decadal variability creates conditions for high rates of pH change since the beginning of the mooring record. Anthropogenic CO2 increases play a dominant role in significant observed seawater pCO2 trends of +2.3 to +3.3 µatm yr−1 and pH trends of −0.0018 to −0.0026 yr−1 across the full time series in this region. However, increased upwelling driven by increased trade winds, a shallower thermocline, and increased frequency of La Ni{\~n}a events also contribute an average of 40\% of the observed trends since 1998. These trends are higher than previous estimates based on underway observations and suggest that the equatorial Pacific is contributing a greater amount of CO2 to the atmospheric CO2 inventory over the last decade.},

@article{chavez_comparison_2009,
	Abstract = {Coastal upwelling along eastern boundaries has fascinated oceanographers for decades. The strong coupling between atmospheric forcing, ocean circulation, biogeochemical cycling, and food web dynamics encouraged oceanographers to conduct multidisciplinary scientific studies that have since become common. Following that tradition, an interdisciplinary approach is taken to highlight differences between the major Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems (EBUE's). Ocean basin-scale settings are important determinants of EBUE characteristics. First, trade winds accumulate heat and mass in the western side of the basins, deepening the thermocline in the west and raising it in the east. Second, and especially prominent in the Pacific, these properties are redistributed eastwards on interannual and multidecadal time scales, reducing the characteristically high biological productivity found in the eastern basin margins. Thirdly, north--south patterns of thermocline doming on the equator and deepening in the subtropical gyres, and high latitude weather-driven mixing makes latitude an important characteristic of each EBUE. As such each EBUE has 3--4 well-defined latitudinally distributed biomes. Many enigmas remain regarding EBUE's including: (1) Why do EBUE's differ dramatically in fish but not in primary production? (2) What nutrients or other physical properties limit EBUE primary production? (3) What roles do subsurface oxygen minimum zones play in EBUE ecosystems? (4) What role do euphausiids play in the transfer of energy through EBUE food webs? (5) What are the roles of EBUE food webs in the biogeochemical cycling of elements? (6) How inter-connected are biomes of EBUE ecosystems? and (7) Most importantly for society, how will EBUE's respond to climate and global change.},

@article{checkley_patterns_2009,
	Abstract = {The California Current System (CCS) is forced by the distribution of atmospheric pressure and associated winds in relation to the west coast of North America. In this paper, we begin with a simplified case of winds and a linear coast, then consider variability characteristic of the CCS, and conclude by considering future change. The CCS extends from the North Pacific Current (∼50$\,^{\circ}$N) to off Baja California, Mexico (∼15--25$\,^{\circ}$N) with a major discontinuity at Point Conception (34.5$\,^{\circ}$N). Variation in atmospheric pressure affects winds and thus upwelling. Coastal, wind-driven upwelling results in nutrification and biological production and a southward coastal jet. Offshore, curl-driven upwelling results in a spatially large, productive habitat. The California Current flows equatorward and derives from the North Pacific Current and the coastal jet. Dominant modes of spatial and temporal variability in physical processes and biological responses are discussed. High surface production results in deep and bottom waters depleted in oxygen and enriched in carbon dioxide. Fishing has depleted demersal stocks more than pelagic stocks, and marine mammals, including whales, are recovering. Krill, squid, and micronekton are poorly known and merit study. Future climate change will differ from past change and thus prediction of the CCS requires an understanding of its dynamics. Of particular concern are changes in winds, stratification, and ocean chemistry.},

@article{chiang_mechanisms_2005,
	Abstract = {The authors demonstrate through atmospheric general circulation model (the Community Climate Model version 3.10) simulations of the 1997/98 El Ni{\~n}o that the observed ``remote'' (i.e., outside the Pacific) tropical land and ocean surface warming appearing a few months after the peak of the El Ni{\~n}o event is causally linked to the Tropics-wide warming of the troposphere resulting from increased atmospheric heating in the Pacific, with the latter acting as a conduit for the former. Unlike surface temperature, the surface flux behavior in the remote Tropics in response to El Ni{\~n}o is complex, with sizable spatial variation and compensation between individual flux components; this complexity suggests a more fundamental control (i.e., tropospheric temperature) for the remote tropical surface warming. Over the remote oceans, latent heat flux acting through boundary layer humidity variations is the important regulator linking the surface warming in the model simulations to the tropospheric warming over the remote tropical oceans. Idealized 1997/98 El Ni{\~n}o simulations using an intermediate tropical circulation model (the Quasi-Equilibrium Tropical Circulation Model) in which individual surface fluxes are directly manipulated confirms this result. The findings over the remote ocean are consistent with the ``tropospheric temperature mechanism'' previously proposed for the tropical ENSO teleconnection, with equatorial planetary waves propagating tropospheric temperature anomalies from the eastern Pacific to the remote Tropics and moist convective processes mediating the troposphere-to-remote-surface connection. The latter effectively requires the boundary layer moist static energy to vary in concert with the free tropospheric moist static energy. Over the remote land regions, idealized model simulations suggest that sensible heat flux regulates the warming response to El Ni{\~n}o, though the underlying mechanism has not yet been fully determined.},

@article{fiechter_air-sea_2014,
	Abstract = {The present study uses a suite of coupled physical-biogeochemical model simulations at 1/3$\,^{\circ}$, 1/10$\,^{\circ}$, and 1/30$\,^{\circ}$ to assess the impact of horizontal resolution on air-sea CO2 fluxes in the California Current System (CCS), a relevant issue for downscaling between coarser resolution global climate models and higher resolution regional models. The results demonstrate that horizontal resolution is important to reproduce the sharp transition between near-shore outgassing and offshore absorption, as well as to resolve regions of enhanced near-shore outgassing in the lee of capes. The width of the outgassing region is overestimated when horizontal resolution is not eddy resolving (i.e., 1/3$\,^{\circ}$) but becomes more dependent on shelf topography for eddy-resolving simulations (i.e., 1/10$\,^{\circ}$ and 1/30$\,^{\circ}$). Enhanced near-shore outgassing is associated with a local increase in wind-driven upwelling in the lee of capes (i.e., expansion fans), meaning that sufficient horizontal resolution is needed both in the ocean circulation model and in the wind field forcing the model. From a global carbon budget perspective, the model indicates that biological production generates sufficient absorption within a few hundred kilometers of the coast to offset near-shore outgassing, which is consistent with the notion that midlatitude eastern boundary current upwelling systems act both as a sink and source for atmospheric CO2. Based on the 1/30$\,^{\circ}$ solution, the CCS between 35 and 45 N and out to 600 km offshore is a net carbon sink of approximately 6 TgC yr−1, with the 1/10$\,^{\circ}$ solution underestimating this value by less than 10\% and the 1/3$\,^{\circ}$ solution by a factor of 3.},

	Abstract = {The California Undercurrent (CUC), a poleward-flowing feature over the continental slope, is a key transport pathway along the west coast of North America and an important component of regional upwelling dynamics. This study examines the poleward undercurrent and alongshore pressure gradients in the northern California Current System (CCS), where local wind stress forcing is relatively weak. The dynamics of the undercurrent are compared in the primitive equation Navy Coastal Ocean Model and a linear coastal trapped wave model. Both models are validated using hydrographic data and current-meter observations in the core of the undercurrent in the northern CCS. In the linear model, variability in the predominantly equatorward wind stress along the U.S. West Coast produces episodic reversals to poleward flow over the northern CCS slope during summer. However, reproducing the persistence of the undercurrent during late summer requires additional incoming energy from sea level variability applied south of the region of the strongest wind forcing. The relative importance of the barotropic and baroclinic components of the modeled alongshore pressure gradient changes with latitude. In contrast to the southern and central portions of the CCS, the baroclinic component of the alongshore pressure gradient provides the primary poleward force at CUC depths over the northern CCS slope. At time scales from weeks to months, the alongshore pressure gradient force is primarily balanced by the Coriolis force associated with onshore flow.},

	Abstract = {Seasonal coastal upwelling was analyzed along the NW African coastline (11--35$\,^{\circ}$N) from 1981 to 2012. Upwelling magnitudes are calculated by wind speed indices, sea-surface temperature indices and inferred from meteorological station, sea-surface height and vertical water column transport data. A permanent annual upwelling regime is documented across 21--35$\,^{\circ}$N and a seasonal regime across 12--19$\,^{\circ}$N, in accordance with the climatology of previous studies. Upwelling regions were split into three zones: (1) the Mauritania--Senegalese upwelling zone (12--19$\,^{\circ}$N), (2) the strong permanent annual upwelling zone (21--26$\,^{\circ}$N) and (3) the weak permanent upwelling zone (26--35$\,^{\circ}$N). We find compelling evidence in our various indices for the Bakun upwelling intensification hypothesis due to a significant coastal summer wind speed increase, resulting in an increase in upwelling-favorable wind speeds north of 20$\,^{\circ}$N and an increase in downwelling-favorable winds south of 20$\,^{\circ}$N. The North Atlantic Oscillation plays a leading role in modifying interannual variability during the other seasons (autumn--spring), with its influence dominating in winter. The East Atlantic pattern shows a strong correlation with upwelling during spring, while El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation teleconnections were not found. A disagreement between observationally-based wind speed products and reanalysis-derived data is explored. A modification to the Bakun upwelling intensification hypothesis for NW Africa is presented, which accounts for the latitudinal divide in summer wind regimes.},

	Abstract = {Food availability and physical constraints such as turbulence are now considered as important factors that affect larval survival and pelagic fish recruitment. In Ekman-type upwelling, vertical advection, new inputs of nutrients and turbulence are linked to wind speed. According to the literature, food availability for larvae is related to biological dynamics (primary production) up to a point where the biological processes are disturbed by physical processes (turbulence generated by wind mixing). This limitation does not exist for non Ekman-type upwelling where upwelling intensity is not correlated with wind speed. We hypothesize that relations between annual recruitments and upwelling intensity are dome shaped in Ekman-type upwellings and linear for non Ekman-type upwellings. A statistical method is used to analyse the form of the relationships between recruitments and upwelling indices or wind mixing.

	Abstract = {This study presents an overview of the El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and Pacific decadal variability (PDV) simulated in a multicentury preindustrial control integration of the NCAR Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) at nominal 1$\,^{\circ}$ latitude--longitude resolution. Several aspects of ENSO are improved in CCSM4 compared to its predecessor CCSM3, including the lengthened period (3--6 yr), the larger range of amplitude and frequency of events, and the longer duration of La Ni{\~n}a compared to El Ni{\~n}o. However, the overall magnitude of ENSO in CCSM4 is overestimated by {\textasciitilde}30\%. The simulated ENSO exhibits characteristics consistent with the delayed/recharge oscillator paradigm, including correspondence between the lengthened period and increased latitudinal width of the anomalous equatorial zonal wind stress. Global seasonal atmospheric teleconnections with accompanying impacts on precipitation and temperature are generally well simulated, although the wintertime deepening of the Aleutian low erroneously persists into spring. The vertical structure of the upper-ocean temperature response to ENSO in the north and south Pacific displays a realistic seasonal evolution, with notable asymmetries between warm and cold events. The model shows evidence of atmospheric circulation precursors over the North Pacific associated with the ``seasonal footprinting mechanism,'' similar to observations. Simulated PDV exhibits a significant spectral peak around 15 yr, with generally realistic spatial pattern and magnitude. However, PDV linkages between the tropics and extratropics are weaker than observed.},

@article{di_lorenzo_warming_2005,
	Abstract = {Long-term changes in the observed temperature and salinity along the southern California coast are studied using a four-dimensional space--time analysis of the 52-yr (1949--2000) California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) hydrography combined with a sensitivity analysis of an eddy-permitting primitive equation ocean model under various forcing scenarios. An overall warming trend of 1.3$\,^{\circ}$C in the ocean surface, a deepening in the depth of the mean thermocline (18 m), and increased stratification between 1950 and 1999 are found to be primarily forced by large-scale decadal fluctuations in surface heat fluxes combined with horizontal advection by the mean currents. After 1998 the surface heat fluxes suggest the beginning of a period of cooling, consistent with colder observed ocean temperatures. Salinity changes are decoupled from temperature and appear to be controlled locally in the coastal ocean by horizontal advection by anomalous currents. A cooling trend of --0.5$\,^{\circ}$C in SST is driven in the ocean model by the 50-yr NCEP wind reanalysis, which contains a positive trend in upwelling-favorable winds along the southern California coast. A net warming trend of +1$\,^{\circ}$C in SST occurs, however, when the effects of observed surface heat fluxes are included as forcing functions in the model. Within 50--100 km of the coast, the ocean model simulations show that increased stratification/deepening of the thermocline associated with the warming reduces the efficiency of coastal upwelling in advecting subsurface waters to the ocean surface, counteracting any effects of the increased strength of the upwelling winds. Such a reduction in upwelling efficiency leads in the model to a freshening of surface coastal waters. Because salinity and nutrients at the coast have similar distributions this must reflect a reduction of the nutrient supply at the coast, which is manifestly important in explaining the observed decline in zooplankton concentration. The increased winds also drive an intensification of the mean currents of the southern California Current System (SCCS). Model mesoscale eddy variance significantly increases in recent decades in response to both the stronger upwelling winds and the warmer upper-ocean temperatures, suggesting that the stability properties of the SCCS have also changed.},

@article{diffenbaugh_observational_2011,
	Abstract = {Given the severe impacts of extreme heat on natural and human systems, we attempt to quantify the likelihood that rising greenhouse gas concentrations will result in a new, permanent heat regime in which the coolest warm-season of the 21st century is hotter than the hottest warm-season of the late 20th century. Our analyses of global climate model experiments and observational data reveal that many areas of the globe are likely to permanently move into such a climate space over the next four decades, should greenhouse gas concentrations continue to increase. In contrast to the common perception that high-latitude areas face the most accelerated response to global warming, our results demonstrate that in fact tropical areas exhibit the most immediate and robust emergence of unprecedented heat, with many tropical areas exhibiting a 50\% likelihood of permanently moving into a novel seasonal heat regime in the next two decades. We also find that global climate models are able to capture the observed intensification of seasonal hot conditions, increasing confidence in the projection of imminent, permanent emergence of unprecedented heat.},

@article{durant_climate_2007,
	Abstract = {ABSTRACT:Climate influences a population through a variety of processes, including reproduction, growth, migration patterns and phenology. Climate may operate either directly through metabolic and reproductive processes or indirectly through prey, predators, and competitors. One mechanism that may be particularly important, and which is the focus of this review, is the role of climate in affecting the reproductive success of a predator through its effect on the relative timing of food requirement and food availability during early life stages. This principle---the match or mismatch of predators' requirement with resource availability---originated in the marine literature, where it initially referred to how growth and survival of fish larvae (predator) depends on this production being synchronous with that of their main food items, i.e. early stage zooplankton (prey). Here we review how the match/mismatch hypothesis (MMH) is used to describe climate effects on ecological patterns and processes in both marine and terrestrial systems. In addition to studying match/mismatch sensu stricto, we expand on it to include effects of overall production level and the spatial aspect. Possible impacts of climate change on match/mismatch are examined in the context of one of the most apparent effects of global warming: an advancement of spring phenology. As a consequence of different species reacting dissimilarly, even minor changes in climate may invoke non-linear responses unbalancing established patterns of synchrony. All components of a food chain cannot be expected to shift their phenology at the same rate, and thus are unlikely to remain synchronous.},

@article{enfield_tropical_1997,
	Abstract = {Past analyses of tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature variability have suggested a dipole behavior between the northern and southern tropics, across the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). By analyzing an improved 43-year (1950--1992) record of SST [Smith et al, 1996] and other data derived from the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS), it is shown that the regions north and south of the ITCZ are statistically independent of each other at the seasonal to interannual timescales dominating the data, confirming the conclusions of Houghton and Tourre [1992]. Some dipole behavior does develop weakly during the boreal spring season, when there is a tendency for SST anomaly west of Angola to be opposite of that in the tropical North Atlantic. It is further shown that tropical Atlantic SST variability is correlated with Pacific El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability in several regions. The major region affected is the North Atlantic area of NE trades west of 40$\,^{\circ}$W along 10$\,^{\circ}$N--20$\,^{\circ}$N and extending into the Caribbean. There, about 50--80\% of the anomalous SST variability is associated with the Pacific ENSO, with Atlantic warmings occurring 4--5 months after the mature phases of Pacific warm events. An analysis of local surface flux fields derived from COADS data shows that the ENSO-related Atlantic warmings occur as a result of reductions in the surface NE trade wind speeds, which in turn reduce latent and sensible heat losses over the region in question, as well as cooling due to entrainment. This ENSO connection is best developed during the boreal spring following the most frequent season of maximum ENSO anomalies in the Pacific. A region of secondary covariability with ENSO occurs along the northern edge of the mean ITCZ position and appears to be associated with northward migrations of the ITCZ when the North Atlantic warmings occur. Although easterly winds are intensified in the western equatorial Atlantic in response to Pacific warm events, they do not produce strong local changes in SST. Contrary to expectations from studies based on equatorial dynamics, these teleconnected wind anomalies do not give rise to significant correlations of SST in the Gulf of Guinea with the Pacific ENSO. As the teleconnection sequence matures, strong SE trades at low southern latitudes follow the development of the North Atlantic SST anomaly and precede by several months the appearance of weak negative SST anomalies off Angola and stronger positive anomalies extending eastward from southern Brazil along 15$\,^{\circ}$--30$\,^{\circ}$S.},

	Abstract = {North Atlantic sea surface temperatures for 1856--1999 contain a 65--80 year cycle with a 0.4 $\,^{\circ}$C range, referred to as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) by Kerr [2000]. AMO warm phases occurred during 1860--1880 and 1940--1960, and cool phases during 1905--1925 and 1970--1990. The signal is global in scope, with a positively correlated co-oscillation in parts of the North Pacific, but it is most intense in the North Atlantic and covers the entire basin there. During AMO warmings most of the United States sees less than normal rainfall, including Midwest droughts in the 1930s and 1950s. Between AMO warm and cool phases, Mississippi River outflow varies by 10\% while the inflow to Lake Okeechobee, Florida varies by 40\%. The geographical pattern of variability is influenced mainly by changes in summer rainfall. The winter patterns of interannual rainfall variability associated with El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation are also significantly changed between AMO phases.},

	Abstract = {Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), primarily from human fossil fuel combustion, reduces ocean pH and causes wholesale shifts in seawater carbonate chemistry. The process of ocean acidification is well documented in field data, and the rate will accelerate over this century unless future CO2 emissions are curbed dramatically. Acidification alters seawater chemical speciation and biogeochemical cycles of many elements and compounds. One well-known effect is the lowering of calcium carbonate saturation states, which impacts shell-forming marine organisms from plankton to benthic molluscs, echinoderms, and corals. Many calcifying species exhibit reduced calcification and growth rates in laboratory experiments under high-CO2 conditions. Ocean acidification also causes an increase in carbon fixation rates in some photosynthetic organisms (both calcifying and noncalcifying). The potential for marine organisms to adapt to increasing CO2 and broader implications for ocean ecosystems are not well known; both are high priorities for future research. Although ocean pH has varied in the geological past, paleo-events may be only imperfect analogs to current conditions.},

	Abstract = {Local and remote wind forcing of upwelling along continental shelves of coastal upwelling regions play key roles in driving biogeochemical fluxes, including vertical net fluxes of carbon and nutrients. These fluxes are responsible for high primary productivity, which in turn supports a lucrative fishery in these regions. However, the relative contributions of local versus remote wind forcing are not well quantified or understood. We present results of coherence analyses between currents at a single mooring site (48.5$\,^{\circ}$N, 126$\,^{\circ}$W) in the northern portion of the California Current System (CalCS) from 1989 to 2008 and coincident time series of North America Regional Reanalysis (NARR) 10 m wind stress within the CalCS (36--54$\,^{\circ}$N, 120--132$\,^{\circ}$W). The two-decade-long current records from the three shallowest depths (35, 100, and 175 m) show a remote response to winds from south as far as 36$\,^{\circ}$N. In contrast, only temperatures at the deepest depth (400 m) show strong coherences with remote winds. Weaker local wind influence is observed in both the currents and 400 m temperatures but is mostly due to the large spatial coherence within the wind field itself. Lack of coherence between distal winds and the 400 m currents suggests that the temperature variations at that depth are driven by vertical motion resulting from poleward travelling coastal trapped waves (CTWs). Understanding the effects of remote forcing in coastal upwelling regions is necessary for determining the occurrence and timing of extreme conditions in coastal oceans, and their subsequent impact on marine ecosystems.},

@article{garcia-reyes_comparison_2017,
	Abstract = {The California Current System (CCS) has two independent seasonal modes of upwelling variability, summer and winter, driven by different atmospheric processes. The variability of upwelling winds during winter is particularly important as strong, episodic events, driven by atmospheric teleconnections with the equatorial Pacific that are active in this season, impact ecological systems along the west coast of North America. Given the importance of upwelling seasonality to ecosystem function, we hypothesize that the Benguela Current System (BCS) shows similar independent seasonal modes of upwelling variability. To test this hypothesis, compare modes of variability between systems, and investigate potential drivers, we use an upwelling index derived from NCEP2 wind data (1979--2014) for the northern, southern, and Agulhas Bank areas of the BCS. In the northern and southern BCS, only one mode of upwelling variability is observed: year-round in the north and during the austral spring and summer (October through April) in the south. The Agulhas Bank region shows two modes of seasonal variability. Based on this 35-year dataset, summer upwelling modes in both the CCS and BCS appear to have similar decadal-scale variability. The other modes of variability (winter mode in the CCS and the non-seasonal second mode in the BCS) are correlated with year-to-year variability in the positioning of regional oceanic high-pressure systems. The leading mode of upwelling variability in the Agulhas Bank region, in the austral summer/fall, is highly correlated with sea level pressure as well as sea surface temperature in the equatorial Pacific, in a spatial and seasonal pattern (boreal winter) resembling the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation. Across the CCS, modes of upwelling variability are similar to one another, while modes differ between regions in the BCS. This difference could lead to regional mismatches in favorable ecological conditions. In contrast with the spatially synchronous winter variability influencing the entire CCS ecosystem, substantial regional variation in the BCS may have strong effects on ecosystem functions, especially for species (e.g., small pelagic fish) that migrate between the Agulhas Bank and other areas of the BCS.},

@article{orr_anthropogenic_2005,
	Abstract = {Today's surface ocean is saturated with respect to calcium carbonate, but increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are reducing ocean pH and carbonate ion concentrations, and thus the level of calcium carbonate saturation. Experimental evidence suggests that if these trends continue, key marine organisms---such as corals and some plankton---will have difficulty maintaining their external calcium carbonate skeletons. Here we use 13 models of the ocean--carbon cycle to assess calcium carbonate saturation under the IS92a 'business-as-usual' scenario for future emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. In our projections, Southern Ocean surface waters will begin to become undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a metastable form of calcium carbonate, by the year 2050. By 2100, this undersaturation could extend throughout the entire Southern Ocean and into the subarctic Pacific Ocean. When live pteropods were exposed to our predicted level of undersaturation during a two-day shipboard experiment, their aragonite shells showed notable dissolution. Our findings indicate that conditions detrimental to high-latitude ecosystems could develop within decades, not centuries as suggested previously.},

	Abstract = {Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations over the past two centuries have led to greater CO2 uptake by the oceans. This acidification process has changed the saturation state ofthe oceans with respect to calcium carbonate (CaCO3) particles. Here we estimate the in situ CaCO3 dissolution rates for the global oceans from total alkalinity and chlorofluorocarbon data, and we also discuss the future impacts of anthropogenic CO2 on CaCO3 shell--forming species. CaCO3 dissolution rates, ranging from 0.003 to 1.2 micromoles per kilogram per year, are observed beginning near the aragonite saturation horizon. The total water column CaCO3 dissolution rate for the global oceans is approximately 0.5 $\pm$ 0.2 petagrams of CaCO3-C per year, which is approximately 45 to 65\% of the export production of CaCO3.
The oceans have taken up nearly half of the anthropogenically emitted CO2 since 1800, lowering the pH; future CO2 uptake may hinder the growth of calcium carbonate--containing plankton and corals.

@article{fay_global_2013,
	Abstract = {Ocean carbon uptake substantially reduces the rate of anthropogenic carbon accumulation in the atmosphere and thus slows global climate change. In the interest of understanding how this ocean carbon sink has responded to climate variability and climate change in recent decades, trends in globally observed surface ocean partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2s.ocean) are evaluated over 16 gyre-scale biomes covering the globe. Trends from decadal to multidecadal timescales between 1981 and 2010 are considered. On decadal timescales, pCO2s.ocean trends have been of variable magnitude and sensitive to the chosen start and end years. On longer time frames, several regions of the tropics and subtropics display pCO2s.ocean trends that are parallel to or shallower than trends in atmospheric pCO2, consistent with the ocean's long-term response to carbon accumulation in the atmosphere and with the supply of waters with low anthropogenic carbon from the deep ocean. Data are too sparse in the high latitudes to determine this long-term response. In many biomes, pCO2s.ocean trends steeper than atmospheric trends do occur on shorter timescales, which is consistent with forcing by climatic variability. In the Southern Ocean, the influence of a positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode has waned and the carbon sink has strengthened since the early 2000s. In North Atlantic subtropical and equatorial biomes, warming has become a significant and persistent contributor to the observed increase in pCO2s.ocean since the mid-2000s. This long-term warming, previously attributed to both multidecadal climate variability and anthropogenic forcing, is beginning to reduce ocean carbon uptake.},

	Abstract = {The absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into the ocean lowers the pH of the waters. This so-called ocean acidification could have important consequences for marine ecosystems. To better understand the extent of this ocean acidification in coastal waters, we conducted hydrographic surveys along the continental shelf of western North America from central Canada to northern Mexico. We observed seawater that is undersaturated with respect to aragonite upwelling onto large portions of the continental shelf, reaching depths of ∼40 to 120 meters along most transect lines and all the way to the surface on one transect off northern California. Although seasonal upwelling of the undersaturated waters onto the shelf is a natural phenomenon in this region, the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has increased the areal extent of the affected area.
As a result of anthropogenic CO2 uptake, corrosive seawater undersaturated with calcium carbonate shoaled on the continental shelf of western North America in 2007.

@article{garcia-reyes_integrated_2013,
	Abstract = {Ecosystem-based management requires integrated physical studies on biological functions. In this study, we hypothesized that seasonal variation in upwelling-favorable winds has differential influences on species of the central California Current pelagic ecosystem. To test this hypothesis, we developed multivariate indicators of upwelling and species' responses using wind and sea surface temperature (SST) data from buoys and growth and reproductive data for 11 species of fish and seabirds. From previous work, we predicted that winds and SST could be decomposed into winter and spring/summer `modes' of variability, but only a single mode of ``winter/spring'' environmental variability was observed. We attribute this difference from expectations to the local and shorter-term measurements of winds and SST used in this study. Most species responded to winds and SST variability similarly, but SST was a better predictor of most biological responses. Both SST and wind were better predictors than the traditional upwelling index. Notably, Pacific sardine (Sardinops sajax) was disassociated with the other biotic measurements and showed no relationships with coastal upwelling. The multivariate indicators developed here are particularly appropriate for integrated ecosystem assessments of climatic influences on marine life because they reflect both structure and processes (upwelling and timing/growth/productivity) known to determine functions in marine ecosystems.},

@article{garcia-reyes_under_2015,
	Abstract = {The IPCC AR5 provided an overview of the likely effects of climate change on Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS), stimulating increased interest in research examining the issue. We use these recent studies to develop a new synthesis describing climate change impacts on EBUS. We find that model and observational data suggest coastal upwelling-favorable winds in poleward portions of EBUS have intensified and will continue to do so in the future. Although evidence is weak in data that are presently available, future projections show that this pattern might be driven by changes in the positioning of the oceanic high-pressure systems rather than by deepening of the continental low-pressure systems, as previously proposed. There is low confidence regarding the future effects of climate change on coastal temperatures and biogeochemistry due to uncertainty in the countervailing responses to increasing upwelling and coastal warming, the latter of which could increase thermal stratification and render upwelling less effective in lifting nutrient-rich deep waters into the photic zone. Although predictions of ecosystem responses are uncertain, EBUS experience considerable natural variability and may be inherently resilient. However, multi-trophic level, end-to-end (i.e., "winds to whales") studies are needed to resolve the resilience of EBUS to climate change, especially their response to long-term trends or extremes that exceed pre-industrial ranges.},

@article{gruber_warming_2011,
	Abstract = {In the coming decades and centuries, the ocean's biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems will become increasingly stressed by at least three independent factors. Rising temperatures, ocean acidification and ocean deoxygenation will cause substantial changes in the physical, chemical and biological environment, which will then affect the ocean's biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems in ways that we are only beginning to fathom. Ocean warming will not only affect organisms and biogeochemical cycles directly, but will also increase upper ocean stratification. The changes in the ocean's carbonate chemistry induced by the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) (i.e. ocean acidification) will probably affect many organisms and processes, although in ways that are currently not well understood. Ocean deoxygenation, i.e. the loss of dissolved oxygen (O2) from the ocean, is bound to occur in a warming and more stratified ocean, causing stress to macro-organisms that critically depend on sufficient levels of oxygen. These three stressors---warming, acidification and deoxygenation---will tend to operate globally, although with distinct regional differences. The impacts of ocean acidification tend to be strongest in the high latitudes, whereas the low-oxygen regions of the low latitudes are most vulnerable to ocean deoxygenation. Specific regions, such as the eastern boundary upwelling systems, will be strongly affected by all three stressors, making them potential hotspots for change. Of additional concern are synergistic effects, such as ocean acidification-induced changes in the type and magnitude of the organic matter exported to the ocean's interior, which then might cause substantial changes in the oxygen concentration there. Ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation are essentially irreversible on centennial time scales, i.e. once these changes have occurred, it will take centuries for the ocean to recover. With the emission of CO2 being the primary driver behind all three stressors, the primary mitigation strategy is to reduce these emissions.},

	Abstract = {The North Atlantic is believed to represent the largest ocean sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide in the Northern Hemisphere, yet little is known about its temporal variability. We report an 18-year time series of upper-ocean inorganic carbon observations from the northwestern subtropical North Atlantic near Bermuda that indicates substantial variability in this sink. We deduce that the carbon variability at this site is largely driven by variations in winter mixed-layer depths and by sea surface temperature anomalies. Because these variations tend to occur in a basinwide coordinated pattern associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation, it is plausible that the entire North Atlantic Ocean may vary in concert, resulting in a variability of the strength of the North Atlantic carbon sink of about $\pm$0.3 petagrams of carbon per year (1 petagram = 1015grams) or nearly $\pm$50\%. This extrapolation is supported by basin-wide estimates from atmospheric carbon dioxide inversions.},

@article{hales_satellite-based_2012,
	Abstract = {Continental margin carbon cycling is complex, highly variable over a range of space and time scales, and forced by multiple physical and biogeochemical drivers. Predictions of globally significant air--sea CO2 fluxes in these regions have been extrapolated based on very sparse data sets. We present here a method for predicting coastal surface-water pCO2 from remote-sensing data, based on self organizing maps (SOMs) and a nonlinear semi-empirical model of surface water carbonate chemistry. The model used simple empirical relationships between carbonate chemistry (total dissolved carbon dioxide (TCO2) and alkalinity (TAlk)) and satellite data (sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll (Chl)). Surface-water CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) was calculated from the empirically-predicted TCO2 and TAlk. This directly incorporated the inherent nonlinearities of the carbonate system, in a completely mechanistic manner. The model's empirical coefficients were determined for a target study area of the central North American Pacific continental margin (22--50$\,^{\circ}$N, within 370km of the coastline), by optimally reproducing a set of historical observations paired with satellite data. The model-predicted pCO2 agreed with the highly variable observations with a root mean squared (RMS) deviation of {\textless}20μatm, and with a correlation coefficient of {\textgreater}0.8 (r=0.81; r2=0.66). This level of accuracy is a significant improvement relative to that of simpler models that did not resolve the biogeochemical sub-regions or that relied on linear dependences on input parameters. Air--sea fluxes based on these pCO2 predictions and satellite-based wind speed measurements suggest that the region is a ∼14TgCyr−1 sink for atmospheric CO2 over the 1997--2005 period, with an approximately equivalent uncertainty, compared with a ∼0.5TgCyr−1 source predicted by a recent bin-averaging and interpolation-based estimate for the same area.},

@article{garcia-reyes_synoptic-scale_2014,
	Abstract = {Seasonal upwelling is responsible for the biologically rich and productive ecosystems of coastal eastern boundary currents. In most studies of physical -- biological interactions in these systems, upwelling statistics are computed on monthly, seasonal, and annual time scales, whereas upwelling naturally occurs at high frequencies (days to weeks). This simplification of the upwelling process may misrepresent relationships between upwelling and biological populations. Based on 31years (1982--2012) of hourly-measured winds and sea surface temperature at buoys off the central-northern California coast, we characterized upwelling and relaxation events at synoptic time scales, and used event-scale statistics to relate to local lower trophic level populations. We defined three metrics to quantify synoptic-scale upwelling: (i) Intensity, a measure of cumulative wind stress forcing during each upwelling event, (ii) SSTevent, a measure of the oceanic response to wind forcing, and (iii) Nutrient Upwelling Index (NUI), a measure of the nitrate availability at the surface during upwelling events. We compared cumulative values of Intensity and NUI, and average values of SSTevent during the peak of the upwelling season (April--June in central-northern California) to proxies of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a concentrations) and krill abundance to assess the abilities of high frequency upwelling indices to predict biology. Wind forcing alone (Intensity) did not explain population variability, but SSTevent and NUI showed excellent relationships to chlorophyll concentrations (44\% and 54\% of variance explained, respectively) and krill abundance (68\% of variance explained). All relationships appeared to be dome-shaped, supporting the hypothesis that moderate upwelling and ocean temperature are optimal for these populations. SSTevent and NUI performed better than the traditional Bakun upwelling index in predicting populations. We conclude that investigating upwelling characteristics on event scales can improve understanding of lower trophic level dynamics in eastern boundary current systems.},

@article{gruber_rapid_2012,
	Abstract = {Acidification Blues
The increase in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide threatens the health of the ocean's ecosystems because of the resulting acidification of the ocean and the decrease in its carbonate saturation state. Gruber et al. (p. 220, published online 14 June) used a regional ocean model to project how the saturation state of aragonite, a form of calcium carbonate that is produced by many marine organisms, will change in the California Current System through the year 2050. The sea floor along many parts of the California coast is likely to become exposed to year-round aragonite undersaturation within the next 20 to 30 years, a situation that could severely reduce the range of habitats for marine shellfish.
Nearshore waters of the California Current System (California CS) already have a low carbonate saturation state, making them particularly susceptible to ocean acidification. We used eddy-resolving model simulations to study the potential development of ocean acidification in this system up to the year 2050 under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A2 and B1 scenarios. In both scenarios, the saturation state of aragonite Ωarag is projected to drop rapidly, with much of the nearshore region developing summer-long undersaturation in the top 60 meters within the next 30 years. By 2050, waters with Ωarag above 1.5 will have largely disappeared, and more than half of the waters will be undersaturated year-round. Habitats along the sea floor will become exposed to year-round undersaturation within the next 20 to 30 years. These projected events have potentially major implications for the rich and diverse ecosystem that characterizes the California CS.
Rising concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide threaten to amplify the severity of ocean acidification in upwelling zones.

This global coupled model significantly extends its predecessor, the Community Climate System Model, by incorporating new Earth system simulation capabilities. These comprise the ability to simulate biogeochemical cycles, including those of carbon and nitrogen, a variety of atmospheric chemistry options, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and an atmosphere that extends to the lower thermosphere. These and other new model capabilities are enabling investigations into a wide range of pressing scientific questions, providing new foresight into possible future climates and increasing our collective knowledge about the behavior and interactions of the Earth system. Simulations with numerous configurations of the CESM have been provided to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and are being analyzed by the broad community of scientists. Additionally, the model source code and associated documentation are freely available to the scientific community to use for Earth system studies, making it a true community tool.

@article{hutchings_benguela_2009,
	Abstract = {The Benguela system is one of the four major eastern boundary upwelling systems of the world. It is unusual as there are two stratified subtropical or warm temperate boundary regions, on either side of the major wind-driven upwelling region(19--34$\,^{\circ}$S), which itself is subdivided at 26$\,^{\circ}$S by the powerful Luderitz upwelling cell. Important biological components cross the boundary areas at different stages to complete the life-history cycle. While the ``Bakun triad'' of factors responsible for the development of large pelagic fish populations (enrichment, concentration and retention) provide an important unifying principle for understanding the compromise implicit in adaptation to upwelling systems, the role of predation has been neglected, as has the fish yield relative to photosynthesis. The role global climate change will have in the Benguela in terms of shifting boundaries or weakening or intensifying gradients is being explored. The interannual and decadal signals are so strong in the region that long term trends are difficult to distinguish. Intensive resource utilisation and the collapse of several fish stocks occurred in the Benguela region during the 1960s and 1970s, with different recovery trajectories in the north and the south. The Angolan subsystem can be described as a subtropical transition zone between the wind-driven upwelling system and the Equatorial Atlantic, with gentle upwelling-favourable winds, well-defined seasons, intermediate productivity and moderate, declining fisheries. It is separated from the Namibian subsystem by the Angola-Benguela front. The northern Benguela shelf is a typical coastal upwelling system with equatorward winds, cool water, high plankton biomass and moderate to high fish biomass, which is currently in a depleted state. A shift from sardines to horse mackerel occurred during the period 1970--1990, while hake have never fully recovered from intensive fishing pressure up to 1990. Widespread oxygen-depleted waters and sulphur eruptions result from local and remote forcing, restricting the habitat available for pelagic and demersal fish species. The Luderitz--Orange River Cone is an intensive perennial upwelling cell where strong winds, high turbulence and strong offshore transport constitute a partial barrier to epipelagic fish species. Upwelling source water alters in salinity and oxygen, across this boundary zone. A decline in upwelling-favourable winds occurred between 1990 and 2005. The southern Benguela region is characterised by a pulsed, seasonal, wind-driven upwelling at discrete centres and warm Agulhas water offshore. High primary productivity forms a belt of enrichment along the coast, constrained by a front. Low-oxygen water, which only occurs close inshore, may adversely affect some resources. The west coast is primarily a nursery ground for several fish species which spawn on the Agulhas Bank and are transported by alongshore jet currents to the west coast. The Agulhas Bank forms the southern boundary of the Benguela system and it displays characteristics of both an upwelling and a temperate shallow shelf system, with seasonal stratification and mixing, coastal, shelf-edge and dynamic upwelling, moderate productivity and a well oxygenated shelf. A large biomass of fish occupies the Bank during the summer season, with some evidence for tight coupling between trophic levels. A cool ridge of upwelled water, with links to coastal upwelling and to the Agulhas Current, appears to play an important but poorly understood role affecting the distribution and productivity of pelagic fish. A boom in sardine and anchovy populations was accompanied by an eastward shift, followed by 5 years of poor recruitment by sardine but successful recruitment of anchovy, indicating changes in the early life-history patterns of these two species.},

@article{huyer_coastal_1983,
	Abstract = {Coastal upwelling in the California Current system has been the subject of large scale studies off California and Baja California, and of small scale studies off Oregon. Recent studies of the winds along the entire coast from 25$\,^{\circ}$N to 50$\,^{\circ}$N indicate that there are significant along-shore variations in the strength of coastal upwelling, which are reflected in the observed temperature distribution. Active upwelling appears to be restricted to a narrow coastal band (about 10--25 km wide) along the entire coast, but the region influenced by coastal upwelling may be much wider. Intensive observations of the upwelling zone during summer off Oregon show the presence of a southward coastal jet at the surface, a mean vertical shear, a poleward undercurrent along the bottom, and persistently sloping isopycnals over the continental shelf; most of the upwelling there occurs during relatively short periods (several days long) of upwelling-favorable winds. During the upwelling season off Oregon, the offshore Ekman transport is carried by the surface Ekman layer, and the onshore return flow occurs through a quasi-geostrophic interior. It is not known whether the structure and dynamics observed off Oregon are typical of the upwelling zone along the entire coast, though some of the same features have been observed off Baja California. Current and future research will eventually show whether the Oregon results are also applicable in the region of persistently strong upwelling-favorable winds off northern California, and in the region of complex bathymetry off central and southern California.},

@article{jacox_sensitivity_2015,
	Abstract = {A regional ocean model is used to evaluate the roles of wind, surface heat flux, and basin-scale climate variability in regulating the upwelled nitrate supply in the California Current. A strong positive trend in nitrate flux from 1980 to 2010 was driven almost entirely by enhanced equatorward winds, negating a weak negative trend associated with increased surface heat flux. Increased upwelling and nitrate flux are consistent with cooler surface temperatures and higher phytoplankton concentrations observed over the same period. Changes in remote ocean forcing, resulting primarily from basin-scale climate variability (e.g., El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation), drive considerable interannual fluctuations and may dominate the ecosystem response on interannual to decadal time scales. However, comparison with previously published findings suggests that local wind intensification persists through changing basin-scale climate regimes. Understanding the different time scales of variability in forcing mechanisms, and their interactions with each other, is necessary to distinguish transient ecosystem impacts from secular trends.},

@article{small_benguela_2015,
	Abstract = {Of all the major coastal upwelling systems in the world's oceans, the Benguela, located off southwest Africa, is the one that climate models find hardest to simulate well. This paper investigates the sensitivity of upwelling processes, and of sea surface temperature (SST), in this region to resolution of the climate model and to the offshore wind structure. The Community Climate System Model (version 4) is used here, together with the Regional Ocean Modeling System. The main result is that a realistic wind stress curl at the eastern boundary, and a high-resolution ocean model, are required to well simulate the Benguela upwelling system. When the wind stress curl is too broad (as with a 1$\,^{\circ}$ atmosphere model or coarser), a Sverdrup balance prevails at the eastern boundary, implying southward ocean transport extending as far as 30$\,^{\circ}$S and warm advection. Higher atmosphere resolution, up to 0.5$\,^{\circ}$, does bring the atmospheric jet closer to the coast, but there can be too strong a wind stress curl. The most realistic representation of the upwelling system is found by adjusting the 0.5$\,^{\circ}$ atmosphere model wind structure near the coast toward observations, while using an eddy-resolving ocean model. A similar adjustment applied to a 1$\,^{\circ}$ ocean model did not show such improvement. Finally, the remote equatorial Atlantic response to restoring SST in a broad region offshore of Benguela is substantial; however, there is not a large response to correcting SST in the narrow coastal upwelling zone alone.},

@article{kay_community_2014,
	Abstract = {While internal climate variability is known to affect climate projections, its influence is often underappreciated and confused with model error. Why? In general, modeling centers contribute a small number of realizations to international climate model assessments [e.g., phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)]. As a result, model error and internal climate variability are difficult, and at times impossible, to disentangle. In response, the Community Earth System Model (CESM) community designed the CESM Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) with the explicit goal of enabling assessment of climate change in the presence of internal climate variability. All CESM-LE simulations use a single CMIP5 model (CESM with the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5). The core simulations replay the twenty to twenty-first century (1920--2100) 30 times under historical and representative concentration pathway 8.5 external forcing with small initial condition differences. Two companion 1000+-yr-long preindustrial control simulations (fully coupled, prognostic atmosphere and land only) allow assessment of internal climate variability in the absence of climate change. Comprehensive outputs, including many daily fields, are available as single-variable time series on the Earth System Grid for anyone to use. Early results demonstrate the substantial influence of internal climate variability on twentieth- to twenty-first-century climate trajectories. Global warming hiatus decades occur, similar to those recently observed. Internal climate variability alone can produce projection spread comparable to that in CMIP5. Scientists and stakeholders can use CESM-LE outputs to help interpret the observational record, to understand projection spread and to plan for a range of possible futures influenced by both internal climate variability and forced climate change.},

@article{knight_signature_2005,
	Abstract = {Analyses of global climate from measurements dating back to the nineteenth century show an `Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation' (AMO) as a leading large-scale pattern of multidecadal variability in surface temperature. Yet it is not possible to determine whether these fluctuations are genuinely oscillatory from the relatively short observational record alone. Using a 1400 year climate model calculation, we are able to simulate the observed pattern and amplitude of the AMO. The results imply the AMO is a genuine quasi-periodic cycle of internal climate variability persisting for many centuries, and is related to variability in the oceanic thermohaline circulation (THC). This relationship suggests we can attempt to reconstruct past THC changes, and we infer an increase in THC strength over the last 25 years. Potential predictability associated with the mode implies natural THC and AMO decreases over the next few decades independent of anthropogenic climate change.},

	Abstract = {Uptake uptick
Has global warming slowed the uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the Southern Ocean? Landsch{\"u}tzer et al. say no (see the Perspective by Fletcher). Previous work suggested that the strength of the Southern Ocean carbon sink fell during the 1990s. This raised concerns that such a decline would exacerbate the rise of atmospheric CO2 and thereby increase global surface air temperatures and ocean acidity. The newer data show that the Southern Ocean carbon sink strengthened again over the past decade, which illustrates the dynamic nature of the process and alleviates some of the anxiety about its earlier weakening trend.
Science, this issue p. 1221; see also p. 1165
Several studies have suggested that the carbon sink in the Southern Ocean---the ocean's strongest region for the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 ---has weakened in recent decades. We demonstrated, on the basis of multidecadal analyses of surface ocean CO2 observations, that this weakening trend stopped around 2002, and by 2012, the Southern Ocean had regained its expected strength based on the growth of atmospheric CO2. All three Southern Ocean sectors have contributed to this reinvigoration of the carbon sink, yet differences in the processes between sectors exist, related to a tendency toward a zonally more asymmetric atmospheric circulation. The large decadal variations in the Southern Ocean carbon sink suggest a rather dynamic ocean carbon cycle that varies more in time than previously recognized.
Carbon uptake by the Southern Ocean has increased again after its slowdown in the 1990s. [Also see Perspective by Fletcher]

@article{landschutzer_neural_2013,
	Abstract = {The Atlantic Ocean is one of the most important sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), but this sink has been shown to vary substantially in time. Here we use surface ocean CO2 observations to estimate this sink and the temporal variability from 1998 through 2007 in the Atlantic Ocean. We benefit from (i) a continuous improvement of the observations, i.e. the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) v1.5 database and (ii) a newly developed technique to interpolate the observations in space and time. In particular, we use a two-step neural network approach to reconstruct basin-wide monthly maps of the sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) at a resolution of 1$\,^{\circ}$ × 1$\,^{\circ}$. From those, we compute the air--sea CO2 flux maps using a standard gas exchange parameterization and high-resolution wind speeds. The neural networks fit the observed pCO2 data with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 10 μatm and with almost no bias. A check against independent time-series data and new data from SOCAT v2 reveals a larger RMSE of 22.8 μatm for the entire Atlantic Ocean, which decreases to 16.3 μatm for data south of 40$\,^{\circ}$ N. We estimate a decadal mean uptake flux of −0.45 $\pm$ 0.15 Pg C yr−1 for the Atlantic between 44$\,^{\circ}$ S and 79$\,^{\circ}$ N, representing the sum of a strong uptake north of 18$\,^{\circ}$ N (−0.39 $\pm$ 0.10 Pg C yr−1), outgassing in the tropics (18$\,^{\circ}$ S--18$\,^{\circ}$ N, 0.11 $\pm$ 0.07 Pg C yr−1), and uptake in the subtropical/temperate South Atlantic south of 18$\,^{\circ}$ S (−0.16 $\pm$ 0.06 Pg C yr−1), consistent with recent studies. The strongest seasonal variability of the CO2 flux occurs in the temperature-driven subtropical North Atlantic, with uptake in winter and outgassing in summer. The seasonal cycle is antiphased in the subpolar latitudes relative to the subtropics largely as a result of the biologically driven winter-to-summer drawdown of CO2. Over the 10 yr analysis period (1998 through 2007), sea surface pCO2 increased faster than that of the atmosphere in large areas poleward of 40$\,^{\circ}$ N, while in other regions of the North Atlantic the sea surface pCO2 increased at a slower rate, resulting in a barely changing Atlantic carbon sink north of the Equator (−0.01 $\pm$ 0.02 Pg C yr−1 decade−1). Surface ocean pCO2 increased at a slower rate relative to atmospheric CO2 over most of the Atlantic south of the Equator, leading to a substantial trend toward a stronger CO2 sink for the entire South Atlantic (−0.14 $\pm$ 0.02 Pg C yr−1 decade−1). In contrast to the 10 yr trends, the Atlantic Ocean carbon sink varies relatively little on inter-annual timescales ($\pm$0.04 Pg C yr−1; 1 σ).},

	Abstract = {The globally integrated sea--air anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) flux from 1990 to 2009 is determined from models and data-based approaches as part of the Regional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes (RECCAP) project. Numerical methods include ocean inverse models, atmospheric inverse models, and ocean general circulation models with parameterized biogeochemistry (OBGCMs). The median value of different approaches shows good agreement in average uptake. The best estimate of anthropogenic CO2 uptake for the time period based on a compilation of approaches is −2.0 Pg C yr−1. The interannual variability in the sea--air flux is largely driven by large-scale climate re-organizations and is estimated at 0.2 Pg C yr−1 for the two decades with some systematic differences between approaches. The largest differences between approaches are seen in the decadal trends. The trends range from −0.13 (Pg C yr−1) decade−1 to −0.50 (Pg C yr−1) decade−1 for the two decades under investigation. The OBGCMs and the data-based sea--air CO2 flux estimates show appreciably smaller decadal trends than estimates based on changes in carbon inventory suggesting that methods capable of resolving shorter timescales are showing a slowing of the rate of ocean CO2 uptake. RECCAP model outputs for five decades show similar differences in trends between approaches.},

	Abstract = {We present a new observation-based estimate of the global oceanic carbon dioxide (CO2) sink and its temporal variation on a monthly basis from 1998 through 2011 and at a spatial resolution of 1$\,^{\circ}$×1$\,^{\circ}$. This sink estimate rests upon a neural network-based mapping of global surface ocean observations of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) from the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas database. The resulting pCO2 has small biases when evaluated against independent observations in the different ocean basins, but larger randomly distributed differences exist particularly in high latitudes. The seasonal climatology of our neural network-based product agrees overall well with the Takahashi et al. (2009) climatology, although our product produces a stronger seasonal cycle at high latitudes. From our global pCO2 product, we compute a mean net global ocean (excluding the Arctic Ocean and coastal regions) CO2 uptake flux of −1.42 $\pm$ 0.53 Pg C yr−1, which is in good agreement with ocean inversion-based estimates. Our data indicate a moderate level of interannual variability in the ocean carbon sink ($\pm$0.12 Pg C yr−1, 1σ) from 1998 through 2011, mostly originating from the equatorial Pacific Ocean, and associated with the El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation. Accounting for steady state riverine and Arctic Ocean carbon fluxes our estimate further implies a mean anthropogenic CO2 uptake of −1.99 $\pm$ 0.59 Pg C yr−1 over the analysis period. From this estimate plus the most recent estimates for fossil fuel emissions and atmospheric CO2 accumulation, we infer a mean global land sink of −2.82 $\pm$ 0.85 Pg C yr−1 over the 1998 through 2011 period with strong interannual variation.},

Three regions with fairly different behaviors are identified: the region of the subtropical gyre (24$\,^{\circ}$N--33$\,^{\circ}$N) is characterized by a weak seasonality and chlorophyll confined at the coast. The inter-gyre region off Cape Blanc (19$\,^{\circ}$N--24$\,^{\circ}$N) is characterized by a weak seasonality and a persistent large offshore extension of chlorophyll. The region of the recirculation gyre (10$\,^{\circ}$N--19$\,^{\circ}$N) is characterized by a strong seasonality and a large offshore extension of chlorophyll from February to May followed by an abrupt chlorophyll drop that propagates northward from May to June. The seasonal variability is well explained by the seasonal variability in wind-forcing. Nutrient limitation is the key factor that explains the weak offshore extension of chlorophyll in the North. The chlorophyll drop in the South is attributed to the weakening of the wind-forcing and the simultaneous advection of warm water from the South by a coastal and seasonal branch of the North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC). Intraseasonal variability is present in all regions. The cases of good correlation between the intraseasonal variability of the chlorophyll and of the wind-forcing are found to be associated with weak chlorophyll offshore extension and large nutrient limitation.},

	Abstract = {The role of the atmospheric circulation as a ``bridge'' between sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific and those in the midlatitude northern oceans is assessed. The key processes associated with this atmospheric bridge are described using output from four independent simulations with a general circulation model subjected to month to month SST variations observed in the tropical Pacific during the 1946--1988 period and to climatological SST conditions elsewhere (the ``TOGA'' runs). In episodes with prominent SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific, extratropical perturbations in the simulated atmospheric temperature, humidity, and wind fields induce changes in the latent and sensible heat fluxes across the air-sea interface of the midlatitude oceans. These anomalous fluxes in turn lead to extratropical SST changes. The relevance of the atmospheric bridge mechanism is evaluated by driving a motionless, 50-m deep oceanic negative mixed layer model at individual grid points with the local surface fluxes generated in the TOGA runs. The negative feedback of the mixed layer temperature anomalies on the imposed flux forcing is taken into account by introducing a linear damping term with a 5-mouth dissipative time scale. This simple system reproduces the basic spatial and temporal characteristics of the observed SST variability in the North Pacific and western North Atlantic. The two-way air-sea feedbacks associated with the atmospheric bridge are investigated by performing four additional 43-year runs of a modified version of the TOGA Experiment. These new ``TOGA-ML'' runs predict the ocean temperature outside the tropical Pacific by allowing the atmosphere to interact fully with the same mixed layer model mentioned above. The results support the notion that midlatitude ocean-atmosphere interaction can be   modeled as a first-order Markov process, in which the red-noise response of mixed layer temperature is driven by white--noise atmospheric forcing in the presence of linear damping. The amplitude of near-surface atmospheric anomalies appearing in the TOGA-ML runs is higher than that in the TOGA runs. This finding implies that, in the TOGA-ML scenario, the midlatitude oceanic responses to atmospheric driving could exert positive feedbacks on the atmosphere, thereby reinforcing the air-sea coupling. The enhanced atmosphere-ocean interactions operating in TOGA-ML prolong the duration of persistent meteorological episodes in that experiment. A comprehensive survey is conducted of the persistence characteristics simulated in TOGA, TOGA-  ML, and several other experiments subjected to prescribed SST forcing at various sites. Model scenarios in which observed tropical Pacific SST anomalies act in conjunction with SST perturbations in midlatitudes (either prescribed or predicted) are seen to produce the highest frequency of persistent events.},

Since the ocean is a major sink of anthropogenic CO2,an accurate estimate of the present oceanic uptake rate of anthropogenic CO2 is essential for reliable prediction of future atmospheric CO2. This number is difficult to pin down because the net airto-sea CO2 flux is a small difference (about 2 Pg C yr−1, 1 Pg = 1015 g) between two huge fluxes---namely, the uptake and the release of CO2 at sea surface (each about 90 Pg C yr−1).},

	Abstract = {We investigate the interannual variability in the flux of CO2 between the atmosphere and the Southern Ocean on the basis of hindcast simulations with a coupled physical-biogeochemical-ecological model with particular emphasis on the role of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The simulations are run under either pre-industrial or historical CO2 concentrations, permitting us to separately investigate natural, anthropogenic, and contemporary CO2 flux variability. We find large interannual variability ($\pm$0.19 PgC yr−1) in the contemporary air-sea CO2 flux from the Southern Ocean ({\textless}35$\,^{\circ}$S). Forty-three percent of the contemporary air-sea CO2 flux variance is coherent with SAM, mostly driven by variations in the flux of natural CO2, for which SAM explains 48\%. Positive phases of the SAM are associated with anomalous outgassing of natural CO2 at a rate of 0.1 PgC yr−1 per standard deviation of the SAM. In contrast, we find an anomalous uptake of anthropogenic CO2 at a rate of 0.01 PgC yr−1 during positive phases of the SAM. This uptake of anthropogenic CO2 only slightly mitigates the outgassing of natural CO2, so that a positive SAM is associated with anomalous outgassing in contemporaneous times. The primary cause of the natural CO2 outgassing is anomalously high oceanic partial pressures of CO2 caused by elevated dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations. These anomalies in DIC are primarily a result of the circulation changes associated with the southward shift and strengthening of the zonal winds during positive phases of the SAM. The secular, positive trend in the SAM has led to a reduction in the rate of increase of the uptake of CO2 by the Southern Ocean over the past 50 years.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the multidecadal and decadal trends in the flux of CO2 between the atmosphere and the Southern Ocean using output from hindcast simulations of an ocean circulation model with embedded biogeochemistry. The simulations are run with NCEP-1 forcing under both preindustrial and historical atmospheric CO2 concentrations so that we can separately analyze trends in the natural and anthropogenic CO2 fluxes. We find that the Southern Ocean ({\textless}35$\,^{\circ}$S) CO2 sink has weakened by 0.1 Pg C a−1 from 1979--2004, relative to the expected sink from rising atmospheric CO2 and fixed physical climate. Although the magnitude of this trend is in agreement with prior studies (Le Qu{\'e}r{\'e} et al., 2007), its size may not be entirely robust because of uncertainties associated with the trend in the NCEP-1 atmospheric forcing. We attribute the weakening sink to an outgassing trend of natural CO2, driven by enhanced upwelling and equatorward transport of carbon-rich water, which are caused by a trend toward stronger and southward shifted winds over the Southern Ocean (associated with the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM)). In contrast, the trend in the anthropogenic CO2 uptake is largely unaffected by the trend in the wind and ocean circulation. We regard this attribution of the trend as robust, and show that surface and interior ocean observations may help to solidify our findings. As coupled climate models consistently show a positive trend in the SAM in the coming century [e.g., Meehl et al., 2007], these mechanistic results are useful for projecting the future behavior of the Southern Ocean carbon sink.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the impact of century-scale climate changes on the Southern Ocean CO2 sink using an idealized ocean general circulation and biogeochemical model. The simulations are executed under both constant and changing wind stress, freshwater fluxes, and atmospheric pCO2, so as to separately analyze changes in natural and anthropogenic CO2 fluxes under increasing wind stress and stratification. We find that the Southern Ocean sink for total contemporary CO2 is weaker under increased wind stress and stratification by 2100, relative to a control run with no change in physical forcing, although the results are sensitive to the magnitude of the imposed physical changes and the rate of increase of atmospheric pCO2. The air-sea fluxes of both natural and anthropogenic CO2 are sensitive to the surface concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) which responds to perturbations in wind stress and stratification differently. Spatially averaged surface DIC scales linearly with wind stress, primarily driven by changes in the Ekman transport. In contrast, changes in the stratification cause non-linear and more complex responses in spatially averaged surface DIC, involving shifts in the location of isopycnal outcrop for deep and thermocline waters. Thus, it is likely that both wind stress and stratification changes will influence the strength of the Southern Ocean CO2 sink in the coming century.},

	Abstract = {We investigate variability in the surface ocean carbonate ion concentration ([CO32−]) on the basis of a{\textasciitilde}long control simulation with an Earth System Model. The simulation is run with a prescribed, pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 concentration for 1000 years, permitting investigation of natural [CO32−] variability on interannual to multi-decadal timescales. We find high interannual variability in surface [CO32−] in the tropical Pacific and at the boundaries between the subtropical and subpolar gyres in the Northern Hemisphere, and relatively low interannual variability in the centers of the subtropical gyres and in the Southern Ocean. Statistical analysis of modeled [CO32−] variance and autocorrelation suggests that significant anthropogenic trends in the saturation state of aragonite (Ωaragonite) are already or nearly detectable at the sustained, open-ocean time series sites, whereas several decades of observations are required to detect anthropogenic trends in Ωaragonite in the tropical Pacific, North Pacific, and North Atlantic. The detection timescale for anthropogenic trends in pH is shorter than that for Ωaragonite, due to smaller noise-to-signal ratios and lower autocorrelation in pH. In the tropical Pacific, the leading mode of surface [CO32−] variability is primarily driven by variations in the vertical advection of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in association with El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation. In the North Pacific, surface [CO32−] variability is caused by circulation-driven variations in surface DIC and strongly correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, with peak spectral power at 20--30-year periods. North Atlantic [CO32−] variability is also driven by variations in surface DIC, and exhibits weak correlations with both the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. As the scientific community seeks to detect the anthropogenic influence on ocean carbonate chemistry, these results will aid the interpretation of trends calculated from spatially and temporally sparse observations.},

	Abstract = {The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has been described by some as a long-lived El Ni{\~n}o-like pattern of Pacific climate variability, and by others as a blend of two sometimes independent modes having distinct spatial and temporal characteristics of North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variability. A growing body of evidence highlights a strong tendency for PDO impacts in the Southern Hemisphere, with important surface climate anomalies over the mid-latitude South Pacific Ocean, Australia and South America. Several independent studies find evidence for just two full PDO cycles in the past century: ``cool'' PDO regimes prevailed from 1890--1924 and again from 1947--1976, while ``warm'' PDO regimes dominated from 1925--1946 and from 1977 through (at least) the mid-1990's. Interdecadal changes in Pacific climate have widespread impacts on natural systems, including water resources in the Americas and many marine fisheries in the North Pacific. Tree-ring and Pacific coral based climate reconstructions suggest that PDO variations---at a range of varying time scales---can be traced back to at least 1600, although there are important differences between different proxy reconstructions. While 20th Century PDO fluctuations were most energetic in two general periodicities---one from 15-to-25 years, and the other from 50-to-70 years---the mechanisms causing PDO variability remain unclear. To date, there is little in the way of observational evidence to support a mid-latitude coupled air-sea interaction for PDO, though there are several well-understood mechanisms that promote multi-year persistence in North Pacific upper ocean temperature anomalies.},

@article{marinov_response_2010,
	Abstract = {The response of ocean phytoplankton community structure to climate change depends, among other factors, upon species competition for nutrients and light, as well as the increase in surface ocean temperature. We propose an analytical framework linking changes in nutrients, temperature and light with changes in phytoplankton growth rates, and we assess our theoretical considerations against model projections (1980--2100) from a global Earth System model. Our proposed "critical nutrient hypothesis" stipulates the existence of a critical nutrient threshold below (above) which a nutrient change will affect small phytoplankton biomass more (less) than diatom biomass, i.e. the phytoplankton with lower half-saturation coefficient K are influenced more strongly in low nutrient environments. This nutrient threshold broadly corresponds to 45$\,^{\circ}$ S and 45$\,^{\circ}$ N, poleward of which high vertical mixing and inefficient biology maintain higher surface nutrient concentrations and equatorward of which reduced vertical mixing and more efficient biology maintain lower surface nutrients. In the 45$\,^{\circ}$ S--45$\,^{\circ}$ N low nutrient region, decreases in limiting nutrients -- associated with increased stratification under climate change -- are predicted analytically to decrease more strongly the specific growth of small phytoplankton than the growth of diatoms. In high latitudes, the impact of nutrient decrease on phytoplankton biomass is more significant for diatoms than small phytoplankton, and contributes to diatom declines in the northern marginal sea ice and subpolar biomes. In the context of our model, climate driven increases in surface temperature and changes in light are predicted to have a stronger impact on small phytoplankton than on diatom biomass in all ocean domains. Our analytical predictions explain reasonably well the shifts in community structure under a modeled climate-warming scenario. Climate driven changes in nutrients, temperature and light have regionally varying and sometimes counterbalancing impacts on phytoplankton biomass and structure, with nutrients and temperature dominant in the 45$\,^{\circ}$ S--45$\,^{\circ}$ N band and light-temperature effects dominant in the marginal sea-ice and subpolar regions. As predicted, decreases in nutrients inside the 45$\,^{\circ}$ S--45$\,^{\circ}$ N "critical nutrient" band result in diatom biomass decreasing more than small phytoplankton biomass. Further stratification from global warming could result in geographical shifts in the "critical nutrient" threshold and additional changes in ecology.},

@article{mcgregor_rapid_2007,
	Abstract = {Near-shore waters along the northwest African margin are characterized by coastal upwelling and represent one of the world's major upwelling regions. Sea surface temperature (SST) records from Moroccan sediment cores, extending back 2500 years, reveal anomalous and unprecedented cooling during the 20th century, which is consistent with increased upwelling. Upwelling-driven SSTs also vary out of phase with millennial-scale changes in Northern Hemisphere temperature anomalies (NHTAs) and show relatively warm conditions during the Little Ice Age and relatively cool conditions during the Medieval Warm Period. Together, these results suggest that coastal upwelling varies with NHTAs and that upwelling off northwest Africa may continue to intensify as global warming and atmospheric CO2 levels increase.
Upwelling of cool, nutrient-rich waters has dramatically increased in the Atlantic off Morocco, probably because preferential warming of the land has increased alongshore winds.

@article{mckinley_timescales_2016,
	Abstract = {The ocean has absorbed 41 per cent of all anthropogenic carbon emitted as a result of fossil fuel burning and cement manufacture. The magnitude and the large-scale distribution of the ocean carbon sink is well quantified for recent decades. In contrast, temporal changes in the oceanic carbon sink remain poorly understood. It has proved difficult to distinguish between air-to-sea carbon flux trends that are due to anthropogenic climate change and those due to internal climate variability. Here we use a modelling approach that allows for this separation, revealing how the ocean carbon sink may be expected to change throughout this century in different oceanic regions. Our findings suggest that, owing to large internal climate variability, it is unlikely that changes in the rate of anthropogenic carbon uptake can be directly observed in most oceanic regions at present, but that this may become possible between 2020 and 2050 in some regions.},

@article{messie_potential_2009,
	Abstract = {Nitrate supply by coastal upwelling has been estimated for four eastern boundary regions (Benguela, California, Northwest Africa and Peru) by combining surface winds measured from space and in situ vertical nitrate profiles. We use a QuikSCAT 0.25$\,^{\circ}$×0.25$\,^{\circ}$ weekly wind product to assess the seasonal vertical transport induced by wind forcing. The calculation is made from the coast to 150km offshore and the wind-driven upwelling is partitioned into that contributed by Ekman transport and pumping. We assume that on the upwelling event time scale (days) the water brought to the surface originates from a depth of 60m. Seasonal climatologies are used to estimate in situ nitrate concentration at 60m, and nitrate supply is calculated as the product of nitrate concentration times the vertical transport obtained from QuikSCAT. This represents the potential new production, i.e. the amount of nitrate available for phytoplankton primary production, for each region. We find that Benguela, Northwest Africa and Peru have similar levels of nitrate supply and potential new production while California has about 60\% of the other three.},

@article{montecino_humboldt_2009,
	Abstract = {In the Humboldt Current System (HCS), biological and non-biological components, ecosystem processes, and fisheries are known to be affected by multi-decadal, inter-annual, annual, and intra-seasonal scales. The interplay between atmospheric variability, the poleward undercurrent, the shallow oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), and the fertilizing effect of coastal upwelling and overall high primary production rates drive bio-physical interactions, the carbon biomass, and fluxes of gases and particulate and dissolved matter through the water column. Coastal upwelling (permanent and seasonally modulated off Peru and northern Chile, and markedly seasonal between 30$\,^{\circ}$S and 40$\,^{\circ}$S) is the key process responsible for the high biological productivity in the HCS. At present, the western coast of South America produces more fish per unit area than any other region in the world ocean (i.e. ∼7.5×106 t of anchoveta were landed in 2007). Climate changes on different temporal scales lead to alterations in the distribution ranges of anchoveta and sardine populations and shifts in their dominance throughout the HCS. The factors affecting the coastal marine ecosystem that reverberate in the fisheries are crucial from a social perspective, since the economic consequences of mismanagement can be severe. Fish remains are often well-preserved in sediment settings under the hypoxic conditions of the OMZ off Peru and Chile, and reveal multi-decadal variability and centennial-scale changes in fish populations. Sediment studies from the Chilean continental margin encompassing the last 20,000years of deposition reveal changes in sub-surface conditions in the HCS during deglaciation, interpreted to include: a major reorganization of the OMZ; a deglacial increase in denitrification decoupled from local marine productivity; and higher deglacial and Holocene paleoproductivities compared to the Last Glacial Maximum in central-south Chile (35--37$\,^{\circ}$S) while this scheme is reversed for north-central Chile. Multi-scale, interdisciplinary approaches and focused research groups are needed to understand air--sea interactions, plankton dynamics, biomass removal by fisheries, and the transformation and fluxes of matter across the different HCS components. In this paper, we present a multidisciplinary synthesis of the HCS that covers its physics, atmosphere, primary and secondary production, medium and high trophic levels, fisheries including management aspects, and relevant sedimentary studies.},

@article{narayan_trends_2010,
	Abstract = {This study presents linear trends of coastal upwelling intensity in the later part of the 20th century (1960-2001) employing various indices of upwelling, derived from meridional wind stress and sea surface temperature. The analysis was conducted in the four major coastal upwelling regions in the world, which are off North-West Africa, L{\"u}deritz, California and Peru. The trends in meridional wind stress showed a steady increase of intensity from 1960-2001, which was also reflected in the SST index calculated for the same time period. The steady cooling observed in the instrumental records of SST off California substantiated this observation further. It was also noted that the trends in meridional wind stress obtained from different datasets differ substantially from each other. Correlation analysis showed that basin-scale oscillations like the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) could not be directly linked to the observed increase of upwelling intensity off NW Africa and California respectively. The relationship of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) with coastal upwelling off NW Africa turned out to be ambiguous due to a negative correlation between the NAO index and the meridional wind stress and a lack of correlation with the SST index. Our results give additional support to the hypothesis that the coastal upwelling intensity increases globally because of raising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and an associated increase of the land-sea pressure gradient and meridional wind stress.},

@article{newman_pacific_2016,
	Abstract = {The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), the dominant year-round pattern of monthly North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variability, is an important target of ongoing research within the meteorological and climate dynamics communities and is central to the work of many geologists, ecologists, natural resource managers, and social scientists. Research over the last 15 years has led to an emerging consensus: the PDO is not a single phenomenon, but is instead the result of a combination of different physical processes, including both remote tropical forcing and local North Pacific atmosphere--ocean interactions, which operate on different time scales to drive similar PDO-like SST anomaly patterns. How these processes combine to generate the observed PDO evolution, including apparent regime shifts, is shown using simple autoregressive models of increasing spatial complexity. Simulations of recent climate in coupled GCMs are able to capture many aspects of the PDO, but do so based on a balance of processes often more independent of the tropics than is observed. Finally, it is suggested that the assessment of PDO-related regional climate impacts, reconstruction of PDO-related variability into the past with proxy records, and diagnosis of Pacific variability within coupled GCMs should all account for the effects of these different processes, which only partly represent the direct forcing of the atmosphere by North Pacific Ocean SSTs.},

While previous studies have emphasized the role of equatorially excited Kelvin waves, the present study finds that meridional wind anomalies along the southwest African coast contribute substantially. Both observations and model output indicate that sea-surface temperatures along the southwest African coast respond rapidly to changes in meridional wind stress. These wind anomalies form part of a basin-scale weakening of the subtropical anticyclone that extends to the equator. As the weakening begins three months before the peak of the event it might have some predictive potential. Results also indicate that the close correlation between Benguela and Atlantic Ni{\~n}os in observations might result from the large spatially coherent wind stress anomalies associated with the weakened anticyclone.},

	Abstract = {Upwelling of nutrient-rich, subsurface water sustains high productivity in the ocean's eastern boundary currents. These ecosystems support a rate of fish harvest nearly 100 times the global mean and account for {\textgreater}20\% of the world's marine fish catch. Environmental variability is thought to be the major cause of the decadal-scale biomass fluctuations characteristic of fish populations in these regions, but the mechanisms relating atmospheric physics to fish production remain unexplained. Two atmospheric conditions induce different types of upwelling in these ecosystems: coastal, alongshore wind stress, resulting in rapid upwelling (with high vertical velocity, w); and wind-stress curl, resulting in slower upwelling (low w). We show that the level of wind-stress curl has increased and that production of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) varies with wind-stress curl over the past six decades. The extent of isopycnal shoaling, nutricline depth, and chlorophyll concentration in the upper ocean also correlate positively with wind-stress curl. The size structure of plankton assemblages is related to the rate of wind-forced upwelling, and sardine feed efficiently on small plankters generated by slow upwelling. Upwelling rate is a fundamental determinant of the biological structure and production in coastal pelagic ecosystems, and future changes in the magnitude and spatial gradient of wind stress may have important and differing effects on these ecosystems. Understanding of the biological mechanisms relating fisheries production to environmental variability is essential for wise management of marine resources under a changing climate.},

	Abstract = {A leading hypothesis relating productivity with climate variability in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) describes an alternation between warmer, well-stratified periods of low productivity and cooler periods of high productivity. This empirical relationship suggests that productivity will decline with global warming. Here, we explore the response of productivity to future climate change in the CCE using an earth system model. This model projects increases in nitrate supply and productivity in the CCE during the 21st century despite increases in stratification and limited change in wind-driven upwelling. We attribute the increased nitrate supply to enrichment of deep source waters entering the CCE resulting from decreased ventilation of the North Pacific. Decreases in dissolved-oxygen concentration and increasing acidification accompany projected increases in nitrate. This analysis illustrates that anthropogenic climate change may be unlike past variability; empirical relationships based on historical observations may be inappropriate for projecting ecosystem responses to future climate change.},

	Abstract = {Upwelling is critical to the biological production, acidification, and deoxygenation of the ocean's major eastern boundary current ecosystems. A leading conceptual hypothesis projects that the winds that induce coastal upwelling will intensify in response to increased land-sea temperature differences associated with anthropogenic global warming. We examine this hypothesis using an ensemble of coupled, ocean-atmosphere models and find limited evidence for intensification of upwelling-favorable winds or atmospheric pressure gradients in response to increasing land-sea temperature differences. However, our analyses reveal consistent latitudinal and seasonal dependencies of projected changes in wind intensity associated with poleward migration of major atmospheric high-pressure cells. Summertime winds near poleward boundaries of climatological upwelling zones are projected to intensify, while winds near equatorward boundaries are projected to weaken. Developing a better understanding of future changes in upwelling winds is essential to identifying portions of the oceans susceptible to increased hypoxia, ocean acidification, and eutrophication under climate change.},

In this paper, we characterize interannual variability of the North Pacific High over 40 years and investigate how variation in its amplitude and position affect upwelling and biology. We develop a winter upwelling ``pre-conditioning'' index and demonstrate its utility to understanding biological processes. Variation in the winter NPH can be well described by its areal extent and maximum pressure, which in turn is predictive of winter upwelling. Our winter pre-conditioning index explained 64\% of the variation in biological responses (fish and seabirds). Understanding characteristics of the NPH in winter is therefore critical to predicting biological responses in the CCS.},

	Abstract = {Analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) from coastal buoys suggests that the summertime over-shelf water temperature off the U.S. West Coast has been declining during the past 30 years at an average rate of −0.19$\,^{\circ}$C decade−1. This cooling trend manifests itself more strongly off south-central California than off Oregon and northern California. The variability and trend in the upwelling north of off San Francisco are positively correlated with those of the equatorward wind, indicating a role of offshore Ekman transport in the north. In contrast, Ekman pumping associated with wind stress curls better explains the stronger and statistically more significant cooling trend in the south. While the coast-wide variability and trend in SST are strongly correlated with those of large-scale modes of climate variability, they in general fail to explain the southward intensification of the trend in SST and wind stress curl. This result suggests that the local wind stress curl, often topographically forced, may have played a role in the upwelling trend pattern.},

Some have postulated that the increase in wind-driven upwelling is due largely to increased greenhouse gas forcing, but such an association has been speculative. Since global and regional simulations of future wind-driven upwelling do not exist for the California coast, we used a regional climate model (RCM) to estimate changes in wind-driven upwelling under increased CO2 concentrations. Here we show in both equilibrium and transient climate experiments that there is an intensified upwelling season, with some changes in seasonality of upwelling. This intensification may lead to enhanced productivity along the coast of California and possibly ameliorate increases in sea surface temperature due to greenhouse gas forcing.},

	Abstract = {Strong winds, upwelling, and teeming shores
Climate warming has produced stronger winds along some coasts, a result of growing differences in temperature and pressure between land and sea. These winds cause cold nutrient-rich seawater to rise to the surface, affecting climate and fueling marine productivity. Sydeman et al. examined data from the five major world regions where upwelling is occurring. Particularly in the California, Humboldt, and Benguela upwelling systems, winds have become stronger over the past 60 years. These regions represent up to a fifth of wild marine fish catches and are hot spots of biodiversity.
Science, this issue p. 77
In 1990, Andrew Bakun proposed that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations would force intensification of upwelling-favorable winds in eastern boundary current systems that contribute substantial services to society. Because there is considerable disagreement about whether contemporary wind trends support Bakun's hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis of the literature on upwelling-favorable wind intensification. The preponderance of published analyses suggests that winds have intensified in the California, Benguela, and Humboldt upwelling systems and weakened in the Iberian system over time scales ranging up to 60 years; wind change is equivocal in the Canary system. Stronger intensification signals are observed at higher latitudes, consistent with the warming pattern associated with climate change. Overall, reported changes in coastal winds, although subtle and spatially variable, support Bakun's hypothesis of upwelling intensification in eastern boundary current systems.
Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations have caused windier conditions in most major coastal upwelling regions.

	Abstract = {Seasonal data for pCO2 and the concentrations of CO2 and nutrients in high-latitude surface oceans obtained by the Lamont-Doherty CO2 group and Marine Research Institute, Reykjavik, are presented and analyzed. The seasonal progression and relationships between these properties are described, and their inter-ocean variation is compared. Spring phytoplankton blooms in the surface water of the North Atlantic Ocean and Iceland Sea caused a precipitous reduction of surface water pCO2 and the concentrations of CO2 and nutrients within two weeks, and proceeded until the nutrient salts were exhausted. This type of seasonal behavior is limited to the high-latitude (north of approximately 40$\,^{\circ}$N) North Atlantic Ocean and adjoining seas. In contrast, seasonal changes in CO2 and nutrients were more gradual in the North Pacific and the nutrients were only partially consumed in the surface waters of the subarctic North Pacific Ocean and Southern Ocean. The magnitude of seasonal changes in nutrient concentrations in the North Pacific and Southern Oceans was similar to that observed in the North Atlantic and adjoining seas. In the subpolar and polar waters of the North and South Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, pCO2 and the concentrations Of CO2 and nutrients were much higher during winter than summer. During winter, the high latitude areas of the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Weddell Sea were sources for atmospheric CO2; during summer, they became CO2 sinks. This is attributed to the upwelling of deep waters rich in CO2 and nutrients during winter, and the intense photosynthesis occurring in strongly stratified upper layers during summer. On the other hand, subtropical waters were a CO2 source in summer and a sink in winter. Since these waters were depleted of nutrients and could only sustain low levels of primary production, the seasonal variation of pCO2 in subtropical waters and the CO2 sink/source condition were governed primarily by temperature. An intense CO2 sink zone was found along the confluence of the subtropical and subpolar waters (or the subtropical convergence). Its formation is attributed to the combined effects of cooling in subtropical waters and photosynthetic drawdown of CO2 in subpolar waters.},

	Abstract = {Approximately 250,000 measurements made for the pCO2 difference between surface water and the marine atmosphere, ΔpCO2, have been assembled for the global oceans. Observations made in the equatorial Pacific during El Nino events have been excluded from the data set. These observations are mapped on the global 4$\,^{\circ}$ × 5$\,^{\circ}$ grid for a single virtual calendar year (chosen arbitrarily to be 1990) representing a non-El Nino year. Monthly global distributions of ΔpCO2 have been constructed using an interpolation method based on a lateral advection--diffusion transport equation. The net flux of CO2 across the sea surface has been computed using ΔpCO2 distributions and CO2 gas transfer coefficients across sea surface. The annual net uptake flux of CO2 by the global oceans thus estimated ranges from 0.60 to 1.34 Gt-C⋅yr−1 depending on different formulations used for wind speed dependence on the gas transfer coefficient. These estimates are subject to an error of up to 75\% resulting from the numerical interpolation method used to estimate the distribution of ΔpCO2 over the global oceans. Temperate and polar oceans of the both hemispheres are the major sinks for atmospheric CO2, whereas the equatorial oceans are the major sources for CO2. The Atlantic Ocean is the most important CO2 sink, providing about 60\% of the global ocean uptake, while the Pacific Ocean is neutral because of its equatorial source flux being balanced by the sink flux of the temperate oceans. The Indian and Southern Oceans take up about 20\% each.},

The errors associated with the wind-speed variation have been estimated using one standard deviation (about$\pm$2ms−1) from the mean monthly wind speed observed over each 4$\,^{\circ}$×5$\,^{\circ}$ pixel area of the global oceans. The new global uptake flux obtained with the Wanninkhof (wind speed)2 dependence is compared with those obtained previously using a smaller number of measurements, about 250,000 and 550,000, respectively, and are found to be consistent within$\pm$0.2Pg Cyr−1. This estimate for the global ocean uptake flux is consistent with the values of 2.0$\pm$0.6Pg Cyr−1 estimated on the basis of the observed changes in the atmospheric CO2 and oxygen concentrations during the 1990s (Nature 381 (1996) 218; Science 287 (2000) 2467). However, if the (wind speed)3 dependence of Wanninkhof and McGillis (Res. Lett. 26 (1999) 1889) is used instead, the annual ocean uptake as well as the sensitivity to wind-speed variability is increased by about 70\%. A zone between 40$\,^{\circ}$ and 60$\,^{\circ}$ latitudes in both the northern and southern hemispheres is found to be a major sink for atmospheric CO2. In these areas, poleward-flowing warm waters meet and mix with the cold subpolar waters rich in nutrients. The pCO2 in the surface water is decreased by the cooling effect on warm waters and by the biological drawdown of pCO2 in subpolar waters. High wind speeds over these low pCO2 waters increase the CO2 uptake rate by the ocean waters. The pCO2 in surface waters of the global oceans varies seasonally over a wide range of about 60\% above and below the current atmospheric pCO2 level of about 360μatm. A global map showing the seasonal amplitude of surface-water pCO2 is presented. The effect of biological utilization of CO2 is differentiated from that of seasonal temperature changes using seasonal temperature data. The seasonal amplitude of surface-water pCO2 in high-latitude waters located poleward of about 40$\,^{\circ}$ latitude and in the equatorial zone is dominated by the biology effect, whereas that in the temperate gyre regions is dominated by the temperature effect. These effects are about 6 months out of phase. Accordingly, along the boundaries between these two regimes, they tend to cancel each other, forming a zone of small pCO2 amplitude. In the oligotrophic waters of the northern and southern temperate gyres, the biology effect is about 35μatm on average. This is consistent with the biological export flux estimated by Laws et al. (Glob. Biogeochem. Cycles 14 (2000) 1231). Small areas such as the northwestern Arabian Sea and the eastern equatorial Pacific, where seasonal upwelling occurs, exhibit intense seasonal changes in pCO2 due to the biological drawdown of CO2.
Une distribution climatologique mensuelle moyenne de pCO2 de surface de l'oc{\'e}an mondial a {\'e}t{\'e} {\'e}tablie pour l'ann{\'e}e 1995 (pour les ann{\'e}es sans El Ni{\~n}o) {\`a} partir de 940.000 mesures dans les eaux de surface, acquises depuis l'Ann{\'e}e G{\'e}ophysique Internationale (1956--59), avec une r{\'e}solution spatiale de 4$\,^{\circ}$×5$\,^{\circ}$. Les flux de CO2 air-mer ont {\'e}t{\'e} ensuite calcul{\'e}s, {\`a} l'{\'e}chelle mensuelle et annuelle, en utilisant la distribution des vents mensuels du NCEP/NCAR moyenn{\'e}s sur 41 ans. Le flux net oc{\'e}anique global de CO2 a {\'e}t{\'e} estim{\'e} {\`a} un puits de 2.2 (+22\% ou --19\%) Pg Can−1 en utilisant l'{\'e}quation de Wanninkhof (Geophys. Res. 97 (1992) 7373) dans laquelle le coefficient de transfert (ou la vitesse de piston) du CO2 est exprim{\'e} en fonction du carr{\'e} de la vitesse du vent; les incertitudes associ{\'e}es {\`a} la vitesse du vent ont {\'e}t{\'e} calcul{\'e}es en utilisant une erreur standard de $\pm$2ms−1 pour un vent moyen observ{\'e} sur chaque pixel de 4$\,^{\circ}$×5$\,^{\circ}$ de l'oc{\'e}an global. Le nouveau flux global ainsi calcul{\'e} (carr{\'e} de la vitesse du vent dans le coefficient de transfert) est {\`a} 0.2Pg Can−1 pr{\`e}s, en accord avec nos estimations ant{\'e}rieures bas{\'e}es respectivement sur 250.000 et 550.000 mesures seulement. Ce r{\'e}sultat est {\'e}galement compatible avec les estimations de 2.0$\pm$0.6PgCan−1 de Keeling et al. (Nature 381 (1996) 218) et de Battle et al. (Science 287 (2000) 2467) bas{\'e}es sur la variation des teneurs en CO2 et oxyg{\`e}ne atmosph{\'e}riques pendant la d{\'e}cennie des ann{\'e}es 90. Cependant l'utilisation de l'{\'e}quation de Wanninkhof et McGillis (Res. Lett. 26 (1999) 1889), faisant intervenir le coefficient de transfert de CO2 exprim{\'e} en fonction du cube de la vitesse du vent, donne des valeurs du flux annuel global ainsi que la sensibilit{\'e} {\`a} la variation de la vitesse du vent plus {\'e}lev{\'e}es de 70\%. Le puits majeur de CO2 atmosph{\'e}rique est situ{\'e} dans la bande de latitude comprise entre 40 et 60$\,^{\circ}$ pour les deux h{\'e}misph{\`e}res, o{\`u} les eaux chaudes se dirigeant vers vers le p{\^o}le convergent et se m{\'e}langent avec des eaux froides subpolaires riches en sels nutritifs. La diminution de pCO2 des eaux de surface subpolaires est due {\`a} la fois {\`a} leur refroidissement et {\`a} la pompe biologique. L'intensit{\'e} des vents dans ces r{\'e}gions o{\`u} pCO2 est faible en surface intensifie encore le pompage de CO2. La variation saisonni{\`e}re de pCO2 dans les eaux de surface de l'oc{\'e}an global peut atteindre $\pm$60\% de la valeur actuelle de pCO2 atmosph{\'e}rique moyen (360μatm). Une carte de l'amplitude de la variation saisonni{\`e}re de pCO2 dans les eaux de surface ainsi que l'effet de l'utilisation du CO2 par la production biologique et l'influence de la variation saisonni{\`e}re de la temp{\'e}rature (estim{\'e}e en utilisant des donn{\'e}es saisonni{\`e}res de temp{\'e}rature) sont pr{\'e}sent{\'e}es s{\'e}par{\'e}ment. La variation saisonni{\`e}re de pCO2 des eaux de surface situ{\'e}es entre les p{\^o}les et environ 40$\,^{\circ}$ et celles des r{\'e}gions {\'e}quatoriales est principalement due {\`a} l'effet de la pompe biologique, alors que dans les tourbillons des r{\'e}gions centrales c'est l'effet thermique qui domine, ces deux effets {\'e}tant d{\'e}phas{\'e}s d'environ 6 mois. En cons{\'e}quence, dans les r{\'e}gions fronti{\`e}res de ces deux zones les effets thermique et biologique se compensent, ce qui engendre des variations saisonni{\`e}res de pCO2 de faible amplitude. Dans les eaux oligotrophes des tourbillons centraux des r{\'e}gions temp{\'e}r{\'e}es, l'influence de la biologie est estim{\'e} {\`a} 35μatm en moyenne, ce qui est compatible avec le flux biologique export{\'e} estim{\'e} par Laws et al. (Glob. Biogeochem. Cycles 14 (2000) 1231).

	Abstract = {A climatological mean distribution for the surface water pCO2 over the global oceans in non-El Ni{\~n}o conditions has been constructed with spatial resolution of 4$\,^{\circ}$ (latitude) ×5$\,^{\circ}$ (longitude) for a reference year 2000 based upon about 3 million measurements of surface water pCO2 obtained from 1970 to 2007. The database used for this study is about 3 times larger than the 0.94 million used for our earlier paper [Takahashi et al., 2002. Global sea--air CO2 flux based on climatological surface ocean pCO2, and seasonal biological and temperature effects. Deep-Sea Res. II, 49, 1601--1622]. A time-trend analysis using deseasonalized surface water pCO2 data in portions of the North Atlantic, North and South Pacific and Southern Oceans (which cover about 27\% of the global ocean areas) indicates that the surface water pCO2 over these oceanic areas has increased on average at a mean rate of 1.5μatmy−1 with basin-specific rates varying between 1.2$\pm$0.5 and 2.1$\pm$0.4μatmy−1. A global ocean database for a single reference year 2000 is assembled using this mean rate for correcting observations made in different years to the reference year. The observations made during El Ni{\~n}o periods in the equatorial Pacific and those made in coastal zones are excluded from the database. Seasonal changes in the surface water pCO2 and the sea-air pCO2 difference over four climatic zones in the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Southern Oceans are presented. Over the Southern Ocean seasonal ice zone, the seasonality is complex. Although it cannot be thoroughly documented due to the limited extent of observations, seasonal changes in pCO2 are approximated by using the data for under-ice waters during austral winter and those for the marginal ice and ice-free zones. The net air--sea CO2 flux is estimated using the sea--air pCO2 difference and the air--sea gas transfer rate that is parameterized as a function of (wind speed)2 with a scaling factor of 0.26. This is estimated by inverting the bomb 14C data using Ocean General Circulation models and the 1979--2005 NCEP-DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis (R-2) wind speed data. The equatorial Pacific (14$\,^{\circ}$N--14$\,^{\circ}$S) is the major source for atmospheric CO2, emitting about +0.48Pg-Cy−1, and the temperate oceans between 14$\,^{\circ}$ and 50$\,^{\circ}$ in the both hemispheres are the major sink zones with an uptake flux of −0.70Pg-Cy−1 for the northern and −1.05Pg-Cy−1 for the southern zone. The high-latitude North Atlantic, including the Nordic Seas and portion of the Arctic Sea, is the most intense CO2 sink area on the basis of per unit area, with a mean of −2.5tons-Cmonth−1km−2. This is due to the combination of the low pCO2 in seawater and high gas exchange rates. In the ice-free zone of the Southern Ocean (50$\,^{\circ}$--62$\,^{\circ}$S), the mean annual flux is small (−0.06Pg-Cy−1) because of a cancellation of the summer uptake CO2 flux with the winter release of CO2 caused by deepwater upwelling. The annual mean for the contemporary net CO2 uptake flux over the global oceans is estimated to be −1.6$\pm$0.9Pg-Cy−1, which includes an undersampling correction to the direct estimate of −1.4$\pm$0.7Pg-Cy−1. Taking the pre-industrial steady-state ocean source of 0.4$\pm$0.2Pg-Cy−1 into account, the total ocean uptake flux including the anthropogenic CO2 is estimated to be −2.0$\pm$1.0Pg-Cy−1 in 2000.},

@article{thompson_linking_2012,
	Abstract = {Upwelling in eastern boundary current systems is a primary driver of ecosystem productivity. Typically, peak upwelling occurs during spring and summer, but winter upwelling may also be important to ecosystem functions. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that winter and spring/summer upwelling, operating through indirect trophic interactions, are important to a suite of top predators in the California Current. To test this hypothesis, we collated information on upwelling, chlorophyll-a concentrations, zooplankton and forage fish, and related these to predator responses including rockfish growth, salmon abundance, seabird productivity and phenology (timing of egg-laying), and whale abundance. Seabird diets served in part as food web indicators. We modeled pathways of response using path analysis and tested for significance of the dominant paths with multiple regression. We found support for the hypothesis that relationships between upwelling and top predator variables were mediated primarily by intermediate trophic levels. Both winter and summer upwelling were important in path models, as were intermediate lower and mid trophic level functional groups represented by chlorophyll-a, zooplankton, and forage fish. Significant pathways of response explained from 50\% to 80\% of the variation of seabird (Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and common murre (Uria aalge)), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) dependent variables, whereas splitnose rockfish (Sebastes diploproa) showed no significant response pathways. Upwelling and trophic responses for salmon were established for both the year of ocean entry and the year of return, with zooplankton important in the year of ocean entry and forage fish important in the year of return. This study provides one of the first comparative investigations between upwelling and predators, from fish to marine mammals and birds within a geographically restricted area, demonstrates often difficult to establish ``bottom-up'' trophic interactions, and establishes the importance of seasonality of upwelling to various trophic connections and predator demographic traits. Understanding change in the seasonality of upwelling is therefore required to assess dynamics of commercially and recreationally important upper trophic level species in eastern boundary current ecosystems.},

@article{tim_decadal_2015,
	Abstract = {Detecting the atmospheric drivers of the Benguela upwelling systems is essential to understand its present variability and its past and future changes. We present a statistical analysis of a high-resolution (0.1$\,^{\circ}$) ocean-only simulation driven by observed atmospheric fields over the last 60 years with the aim of identifying the large-scale atmospheric drivers of upwelling variability and trends. The simulation is found to reproduce well the seasonal cycle of upwelling intensity, with a maximum in the June-August season in North Benguela and in the December-February season in South Benguela. The statistical analysis of the interannual variability of upwelling focuses on its relationship to atmospheric variables (sea level pressure, 10 m wind, wind stress). The relationship between upwelling and the atmospheric variables differ somewhat in the two regions, but generally the correlation patterns reflect the common atmospheric pattern favouring upwelling: southerly wind/wind stress, strong subtropical anticyclone, and an ocean-land sea level pressure gradient. In addition, the statistical link between upwelling and large-scale climate variability modes was analysed. The El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation and the Antarctic Oscillation exert some influence on austral summer upwelling velocities in South Benguela. The decadal evolution and the long-term trends of simulated upwelling and of ocean-minus-land air pressure gradient do not agree with Bakun's hypothesis that anthropogenic climate change should generally intensify coastal upwelling.},

	Abstract = {A practical step-by-step guide to wavelet analysis is given, with examples taken from time series of the El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovm{\"o}ller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Ni{\~n}o3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index show significantly higher power during 1880--1920 and 1960--90, and lower power during 1920--60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance. The power Hovm{\"o}ller of sea level pressure shows significant variations in 2--8-yr wavelet power in both longitude and time.},

@article{arruda_air-sea_2015,
	Abstract = {We use an eddy-resolving, regional ocean biogeochemical model to investigate the main variables and processes responsible for the climatological spatio-temporal variability of pCO2 and the air-sea CO2 fluxes in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Overall, the region acts as a sink of atmospheric CO2 south of 30$\,^{\circ}$ S, and is close to equilibrium with the atmospheric CO2 to the north. On the shelves, the ocean acts as a weak source of CO2, except for the mid/outer shelves of Patagonia, which act as sinks. In contrast, the inner shelves and the low latitude open ocean of the southwestern Atlantic represent source regions. Observed nearshore-to-offshore and meridional pCO2 gradients are well represented by our simulation. A sensitivity analysis shows the importance of the counteracting effects of temperature and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in controlling the seasonal variability of pCO2. Biological production and solubility are the main processes regulating pCO2, with biological production being particularly important on the shelves. The role of mixing/stratification in modulating DIC, and therefore surface pCO2, is shown in a vertical profile at the location of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) site in the Argentine Basin (42$\,^{\circ}$ S, 42$\,^{\circ}$ W).},

@article{waliser_satellite-derived_1993,
	Abstract = {This paper presents fundamental climatological characteristics of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in a simple concise manner using the highly reflective cloud (HRC) dataset. This satellite-derived dataset uses both visible and infrared observations to measure the frequency of occurrence of large-scale convective systems over the global tropics at a 1$\,^{\circ}$ spatial resolution. These dataset characteristics make the HRC particularly well suited for climatological analysis of the ITCZ because the dataset is based on estimates of organized deep convective cloud systems rather than observations of clouds as a whole, and it provides the spatial resolution needed to identify thew large-wale convective structures. Furthermore, the dataset covers a time period extending nearly two decades, which provides for a fairly robust climatology and the opportunity to examine seasonal and interannual variability of both the convection and the latitude of the ITCZ.},

@article{wang_intensification_2015,
	Abstract = {The timing and strength of wind-driven coastal upwelling along the eastern margins of major ocean basins regulate the productivity of critical fisheries and marine ecosystems by bringing deep and nutrient-rich waters to the sunlit surface, where photosynthesis can occur1-3. How coastal upwelling regimes might change in a warming climate is therefore a question of vital importance4,5. Although enhanced land-ocean differential heating due to greenhouse warming has been proposed to intensify coastal upwelling by strengthening alongshore winds6, analyses of observations and previous climate models have provided little consensus on historical and projected trends in coastal upwelling7-13. Here we show that there are strong and consistent changes in the timing, intensity and spatial heterogeneity of coastal upwelling in response to future warming in most Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUSs). An ensemble of climate models shows that by the end of the twenty-first century the upwelling season will start earlier, end later and become more intense at high but not low latitudes.This projected increase in upwelling intensity and duration at high latitudes will result in a substantial reduction of the existing latitudinal variation in coastal upwelling. These patterns are consistent across three of the four EBUSs (Canary, Benguela and Humboldt, but not California).The lack of upwelling intensification and greater uncertainty associated with the California EBUS may reflect regional controls associated with the atmospheric response to climate change. Given the strong linkages between upwelling and marine ecosystems14,15, the projected changes in the intensity, timing and spatial structure of coastal upwelling may influence the geographical distribution of marine biodiversity.},

@article{gruber_eddy-induced_2011,
	Abstract = {Eddies and other mesoscale oceanic processes, such as fronts, can enhance biological production in the ocean, according to several open-ocean studies. The effect is thought to be particularly pronounced in low-nutrient environments, where mesoscale processes increase the net upward flux of limiting nutrients. However, eddies have been suggested to suppress production in the highly productive eastern boundary upwelling systems. Here, we examine the relationship between satellite-derived estimates of net primary production, of upwelling strength, and of eddy-kinetic energy---a measure of the intensity of mesoscale activity---in the four most productive eastern boundary upwelling systems. We show that high levels of eddy activity tend to be associated with low levels of biological production, indicative of a suppressive effect. Simulations using eddy-resolving models of two of these upwelling systems support the suggestion that eddies suppress production, and show that the downward export of organic matter is also reduced. According to these simulations, the reduction in production and export results from an eddy-induced transport of nutrients from the nearshore environment to the open ocean. Eddies might have a similar effect on marine productivity in other oceanic systems that are characterized by intense eddy activity, such as the Southern Ocean.

This marine heat wave occurred alongside the Gulf of Alaska marine heat wave and resulted in major disturbances in the California Current ecosystem and massive economic impacts. Here we use satellite and blended reanalysis products to report the magnitude, extent, duration, and evolution of SSTs and wind stress anomalies along the West Coast of the continental United States during this event. Nearshore SST anomalies along the entire coast were persistent during the marine heat wave, and only abated seasonally, during spring upwelling-favorable wind stress. The coastal marine heat wave weakened in July 2016 and disappeared by September 2016.},

@article{auger_what_2016,
	Abstract = {A comparative box analysis based on a multi-decadal physical--biogeochemical hindcast simulation (1980--2009) was conducted to characterize the drivers of the spatial distribution of phytoplankton biomass and production in the north-west (NW) African upwelling system. Alongshore geostrophic flow related to large-scale circulation patterns associated with the influence of coastal topography is suggested to modulate the coastal divergence, and then the response of nutrient upwelling to wind forcing. In our simulation, this translates into a coastal upwelling of nitrate being significant in all regions but the Cape Blanc (CB) area. However, upwelling is found to be the dominant supplier of nitrate only in the northern Saharan Bank (NSB) and the Senegalo-Mauritanian (SM) regions. Elsewhere, nitrate supply is dominated by meridional advection, especially off Cape Blanc. Phytoplankton displays a similar behaviour with a supply by lateral advection which equals the net coastal phytoplankton growth in all coastal regions except the Senegalo-Mauritanian area. Noticeably, in the Cape Blanc area, the net coastal phytoplankton growth is mostly sustained by high levels of regenerated production exceeding new production by more than twofold, which is in agreement with the locally weak input of nitrate by coastal upwelling. Further offshore, the distribution of nutrients and phytoplankton is explained by the coastal circulation. Indeed, in the northern part of our domain (i.e. Saharan Bank), the coastal circulation is mainly alongshore, resulting in low offshore lateral advection of nutrients and phytoplankton. Conversely, lateral advection transports coastal nutrients and phytoplankton towards offshore areas in the latitudinal band off the Senegalo-Mauritanian region. Moreover, this latter offshore region benefits from transient southern intrusions of nutrient-rich waters from the Guinean upwelling.},

	Abstract = {Ocean acidification will progress in an episodic manner, yet this has rarely been considered. Here, we investigate how the intensity, duration, and severity of episodic low aragonite saturation state events along the California continental shelf have changed since {\textasciitilde}1750, and how they might change up to 2050 under the A2 scenario from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Our model-based results suggest that between 1750 and 2010, aragonite undersaturation events along the shelf have quadrupled in their number and lengthened in duration, but that even larger changes are bound to occur within the next 20 to 40 years. Undersaturation will become very likely the norm near the seafloor by 2030, and if atmospheric CO2 increases beyond {\textasciitilde}500 ppm, this layer will become permanently undersaturated. Combined with a fourfold increase in intensity, the resulting increase in severity of low aragonite saturation state events will substantially affect the viability of calcifying organisms and will alter ecosystem structure.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the relationship between annually integrated new and export production for the central Californian marine upwelling system using an eddy-resolving coupled physical-ecosystem-biogeochemical model. We find that when averaged over the annual cycle lateral transport leads to a substantial spatial decoupling of export from new production, with a length-scale of decoupling on the order of 300 km. The decoupling is largely caused by mean horizontal fluxes induced by persistent meso- and submesoscale circulation structures and to a lesser degree by the mean lateral offshore transport induced by Ekman transport. This indicates that the concept of numerically equal new and export production has to be used with great care, particularly in dynamic oceanic environments.},

The magnitude and the large-scale distribution of the ocean carbon sink is well quantified for recent decades. In contrast, temporal changes in the oceanic carbon sink remain poorly understood. It has proved difficult to distinguish between air-to-sea carbon flux trends that are due to anthropogenic climate change and those due to internal climate variability. Here we use a modelling approach that allows for this separation, revealing how the ocean carbon sink may be expected to change throughout this century in different oceanic regions. Our findings suggest that, owing to large internal climate variability, it is unlikely that changes in the rate of anthropogenic carbon uptake can be directly observed in most oceanic regions at present, but that this may become possible between 2020 and 2050 in some regions.},

@article{hauri_abrupt_2016,
	Abstract = {Ocean acidification may lead to seasonal aragonite undersaturation in surface waters of the Southern Ocean as early as 2030 (ref. 1). These conditions are harmful to key organisms such as pteropods, which contribute significantly to the pelagic foodweb and carbon export fluxes in this region. Although the severity of ocean acidification impacts is mainly determined by the duration, intensity and spatial extent of aragonite undersaturation events, little is known about the nature of these events, their evolving attributes and the timing of their onset in the Southern Ocean. Using an ensemble of ten Earth system models, we show that starting around 2030, aragonite undersaturation events will spread rapidly, affecting {\textasciitilde}30\% of Southern Ocean surface waters by 2060 and {\textgreater}70\% by 2100, including the Patagonian Shelf. On their onset, the duration of these events will increase abruptly from 1 month to 6 months per year in less than 20 years in {\textgreater}75\% of the area affected by end-of-century aragonite undersaturation. This is likely to decrease the ability of organisms to adapt to a quickly evolving environment. The rapid equatorward progression of surface aragonite undersaturation can be explained by the uptake of anthropogenic CO2, whereas climate-driven physical or biological changes will play a minor role.},

@article{frolicher_sources_2016,
	Abstract = {Future projections of potential ocean ecosystem stressors, such as acidification, warming, deoxygenation, and changes in ocean productivity, are uncertain due to incomplete understanding of fundamental processes, internal climate variability, and divergent carbon emission scenarios. This complicates climate change impact assessments. We evaluate the relative importance of these uncertainty sources in projections of potential stressors as a function of projection lead time and spatial scale. Internally generated climate variability is the dominant source of uncertainty in middle-to-low latitudes and in most coastal large marine ecosystems over the next few decades, suggesting irreducible uncertainty inherent in these short projections. Uncertainty in projections of century-scale global sea surface temperature (SST), global thermocline oxygen, and regional surface pH is dominated by scenario uncertainty, highlighting the critical importance of policy decisions on carbon emissions. In contrast, uncertainty in century-scale projections of net primary productivity, low-oxygen waters, and Southern Ocean SST is dominated by model uncertainty, underscoring that the importance of overcoming deficiencies in scientific understanding and improved process representation in Earth system models are critical for making more robust projections these potential stressors. We also show that changes in the combined potential stressors emerge from the noise in 39\% (34--44\%) of the ocean by 2016--2035 relative to the 1986--2005 reference period and in 54\% (50--60\%) of the ocean by 2076--2095 following a high-carbon emission scenario. Projected large changes in surface pH and SST can be reduced substantially and rapidly with aggressive carbon emission mitigation but only marginally for oxygen. The regional importance of model uncertainty and internal variability underscores the need for expanded and improved multimodel and large initial condition ensemble projections with Earth system models for evaluating regional marine resource impacts.},

@article{laruelle_regionalized_2014,
	Abstract = {Over the past decade, estimates of the atmospheric CO2 uptake by continental shelf seas were constrained within the 0.18--0.45 Pg C yr−1 range. However, most of those estimates are based on extrapolations from limited data sets of local flux measurements (n {\textless} 100). Here we propose to derive the CO2 air-sea exchange of the shelf seas by extracting 3 · 106 direct surface ocean CO2 measurements from the global database SOCAT (Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas), atmospheric CO2 values from GlobalVIEW and calculating gas transfer rates using readily available global temperature, salinity, and wind speed fields. We then aggregate our results using a global segmentation of the shelf in 45 units and 152 subunits to establish a consistent regionalized CO2 exchange budget at the global scale. Within each unit, the data density determines the spatial and temporal resolutions at which the air-sea CO2 fluxes are calculated and range from a 0.5$\,^{\circ}$ resolution in the best surveyed regions to a whole unit resolution in areas where data coverage is limited. Our approach also accounts, for the first time, for the partial sea ice cover of polar shelves. Our new regionalized global CO2 sink estimate of 0.19 $\pm$ 0.05 Pg C yr−1 falls in the low end of previous estimates. Reported to an ice-free surface area of 22 · 106 km2, this value yields a flux density of 0.7 mol C m−2 yr−1, {\textasciitilde}40\% more intense than that of the open ocean. Our results also highlight the significant contribution of Arctic shelves to this global CO2 uptake (0.07 Pg C yr−1).},

	Abstract = {Approximately half of the world's net annual photosynthesis occurs in the oceans (∼48 Pg C y−1). Areas bordering continents (bottom {\textless}2000 m) support 10--15\% of this production. We used satellite data to compute annual global net primary production (1998--2001), and derived the global particulate organic carbon (POC) flux settling below the permanent thermocline and to the seafloor using an empirical model of POC remineralization. Approximately 0.68 Pg C y−1 sink below the thermocline on continental margins, compared to 1.01 Pg C y−1 in the deep ocean. Over 0.62 Pg C y−1 settles to the seafloor on margins, compared to 0.31 Pg C y−1 to deep ocean sediments. At least 0.06 Pg C y−1 may be buried in sediments on margins. Therefore, margins may be responsible for {\textgreater}40\% of the carbon sequestration in the ocean. These regions must be accounted for in realistic models of the global carbon cycle and its linkages to climate change.},

@article{sutton_using_2016,
	Abstract = {One of the major challenges to assessing the impact of ocean acidification on marine life is detecting and interpreting long-term change in the context of natural variability. This study addresses this need through a global synthesis of monthly pH and aragonite saturation state (Ωarag) climatologies for 12 open ocean, coastal, and coral reef locations using 3-hourly moored observations of surface seawater partial pressure of CO2 and pH collected together since as early as 2010. Mooring observations suggest open ocean subtropical and subarctic sites experience present-day surface pH and Ωarag conditions outside the bounds of preindustrial variability throughout most, if not all, of the year. In general, coastal mooring sites experience more natural variability and thus, more overlap with preindustrial conditions; however, present-day Ωarag conditions surpass biologically relevant thresholds associated with ocean acidification impacts on Mytilus californianus (Ωarag {\textless} 1.8) and Crassostrea gigas (Ωarag {\textless} 2.0) larvae in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) and Mya arenaria larvae in the Gulf of Maine (Ωarag {\textless} 1.6). At the most variable mooring locations in coastal systems of the CCE, subseasonal conditions approached Ωarag =  1. Global and regional models and data syntheses of ship-based observations tended to underestimate seasonal variability compared to mooring observations. Efforts such as this to characterize all patterns of pH and Ωarag variability and change at key locations are fundamental to assessing present-day biological impacts of ocean acidification, further improving experimental design to interrogate organism response under real-world conditions, and improving predictive models and vulnerability assessments seeking to quantify the broader impacts of ocean acidification.},

@article{sabine_oceanic_2004,
	Abstract = {Using inorganic carbon measurements from an international survey effort in the 1990s and a tracer-based separation technique, we estimate a global oceanic anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) sink for the period from 1800 to 1994 of 118 $\pm$ 19 petagrams of carbon. The oceanic sink accounts for ∼48\% of the total fossil-fuel and cement-manufacturing emissions, implying that the terrestrial biosphere was a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere of about 39 $\pm$ 28 petagrams of carbon for this period. The current fraction of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions stored in the ocean appears to be about one-third of the long-term potential.
The oceans have taken up nearly half of the anthropogenically emitted CO2 since 1800, lowering the pH; future CO2 uptake may hinder the growth of calcium carbonate--containing plankton and corals.

@article{helmke_northwest_2005,
	Abstract = {We combined the analysis of sediment trap data and satellite-derived sea surface chlorophyll to quantify the amount of organic carbon export to the deep sea in the upwelling induced high production area off northwest Africa. In contrast to the generally global or basin-wide adoption of export models, we used a regionally fitted empirical model. Furthermore, the application of our model was restricted to a dynamically defined region of high chlorophyll concentration in order to restrict the model application to an environment of more homogeneous export processes. We developed a correlation-based approximation to estimate the surface source area for a sediment trap deployed from 11 June 1998 to 7 November 1999 at 21.25$\,^{\circ}$N latitude and 20.64$\,^{\circ}$W longitude off Cape Blanc. We also developed a regression model of chlorophyll and export of organic carbon to the 1000 m depth level. Carbon export was calculated for an area of high chlorophyll concentration ({\textgreater}1 mg m−3) adjacent to the coast on a daily basis. The resulting zone of high chlorophyll concentration was 20,000--800,000 km2 large and yielded a yearly export of 1.123 to 2.620 Tg organic carbon. The average organic carbon export within the area of high chlorophyll concentration was 20.6 mg m−2 d−1 comparable to 13.3 mg m−2 d−1 as found in the sediment trap results if normalized to the 1000 m level. We found strong interannual variability in export. The period autumn 1998 to summer 1999 was exceeding the mean of the other three comparable periods by a factor of 2.25. We believe that this approach of using more regionally fitted models can be successfully transferred even to different oceanographic regions by selecting appropriate definition criteria like chlorophyll concentration for the definition of an area to which it is applicable.},

@article{carr_estimation_2001,
	Abstract = {This study provides a satellite-based estimate of potential primary production in the four Eastern Boundary Currents (EBCs), i.e. the California, Humboldt, Canary, and Benguela currents, from the first 24 months of the Sea-Viewing Wide Field of View Sensor, SeaWiFS. Within each EBC, production was estimated for the area of high chlorophyll concentration ({\textgreater}1mgm−3) or active area, which is likely to determine the production that can be utilized by higher trophic levels. Primary production decreased with latitude within each EBC while the extent of the active area was related to the magnitude of offshore transport. The most productive EBC was the Benguela Current (0.37GtCyr−1), followed by the Canary (0.33GtCyr−1), Humboldt (0.20GtCyr−1), and California (0.04GtCyr−1) Currents. Interannual differences between 1997, 1998, and 1999 were largest for 1997 (measured by the Ocean Color Temperature Scanner, OCTS), which may be due primarily to the different sensor and algorithm. The Humboldt Current was more productive, and the Canary much less, during 1997 than in the two following years. The El Ni{\~n}o of 1997--1998 led to smaller annual production in 1998 in the Pacific EBCs. The upper bound of sustainable fish yield was estimated assuming a food chain of 2.6 links and an average trophic efficiency of 10\%. The resulting values are 4--150 times larger than the observed fish catch from 1990 through 1997. Actual catch data in the Benguela Current were 20 times smaller than in the Humboldt Current. The most likely explanations for the differences in potential and observed fish catch are related to differing trophic structure and spatial accessibility in different EBCs. If the estimated yield is an upper bound that will be decreased to 10\% or 20\% by environmental accessibility, the small pelagic fishery in all four EBCs is likely to be food-limited.},

@article{dugdale_uptake_1967,
	Abstract = {The use of 15N-labeled compounds to obtain specific uptake rates for the various nitrogen sources available to the phytoplankton makes it possible to separate the fractions of primary productivity corresponding to new and regenerated nitrogen in the euphotic zone of the ocean. Measurements of nitrate uptake as a fraction of ammonia plus nitrate uptake have been obtained from the northwest Atlantic and the northeast Pacific oceans. Mean values range from 8.3 to 39.5\%, the former being characteristic of subtropical regions and the latter of northern temperate regions or coastal and inland waters. Nitrogen fixation is also a source of new nitrogen. Rates of nitrogen fixation are found to be as high or higher than nitrate uptake, in some cases suggesting an important role for nitrogen-fixing phytoplankton. The role of zooplankton in regenerating nitrogen as ammonia in the Sargasso Sea is examined theoretically. Probably only about 10\% of the daily ammonia uptake by phytoplankton is contributed by the zooplankton living in the upper 100 m.},

@article{van_geen_carbon_2000,
	Abstract = {The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) and concentrations of the nutrients phosphate (P) and silicate (Si) in coastal surface waters within a 100km×300km area centered on Cape Blanco, Oregon, were mapped at high resolution during August 17--27, 1995. Alkalinity and the concentration of total CO2 were determined on a subset of stored samples. Over the 9--18$\,^{\circ}$C range in sea-surface temperatures encountered during the cruise, PCO2, and P and Si concentrations varied between 150--690μatm, {\textless}0.1--1.8, and {\textless}1--33μmol/kg, respectively. Spatial variations in the intensity of coastal upwelling set the wide range in surface water properties. Acoustic Doppler current profiler data collected throughout the cruise indicate the advective nature of many chemical features. PCO2 data also indicate the presence of an intense phytoplankton bloom in continental shelf waters along the coast north of Cape Blanco, with little evidence of biological drawdown to the south. The available data do not provide an unambiguous explanation for this contrast. Surf-zone water was sampled from shore at 17 locations along the cruise area on August 25 and 26, 1995, concurrently with the shipboard measurements. PCO2, and P and Si concentrations, varied in the range 250--640μatm, 0.3--2.0, and 1.1--42μmol/kg, respectively. North of Cape Blanco, the chemical expression of upwelling was considerably stronger in the surf-zone than at all locations sampled on board ship because the phytoplankton bloom did not extend to the coast. South of Cape Blanco, concentrations of upwelling tracers measured on board ship within a distance of 5--10km from the coast and in the surf-zone were comparable. Vertical nutrient profiles across the continental shelf show that the composition of surf-zone water is consistent with conservative advection of nutrient-enriched bottom water from the edge of the continental shelf to the surf-zone.},

@article{hales_atmospheric_2005,
	Abstract = {A biological pump for transferring atmospheric CO2 to deep ocean regimes has been identified in the upwelling zone of the U.S. Pacific coast off Oregon using high-resolution measurements of PCO2 and nutrient concentrations that were made in May through August 2001. Surface water over most of the shelf was a strong sink for atmospheric CO2, while a narrow nearshore strip was an intense source. The dominance of the low-CO2 waters over the shelf area makes the region a net sink during upwelling season. This is due to (1) upwelled water that carries abundant preformed nutrients, (2) complete photosynthetic uptake of these excess nutrients and a stoichiometric proportion of CO2, and (3) moderate warming of upwelled waters. If the remaining North Pacific's eastern boundary area is assumed to have similar conditions, this area should represent a sink of atmospheric CO2 that is 5\% of the annual North Pacific CO2 uptake, and roughly equivalent to the North Pacific's uptake in the summer season. By mid-August, PCO2 in subsurface waters increased 20--60\%, corresponding to a 1.0--2.3\% TCO2 increase, due to respiration of settling biogenic debris. This water would be transported off the shelf to depth by winter downwelling flow, providing an important mechanism for sequestering atmospheric CO2 into the oceans' interior.},

@article{cai_air-sea_2006,
	Abstract = {In determining global sea-to-air CO2 flux from measurements or models, the ocean margin has not been resolved from the land or the open ocean. Recent studies have indicated that shelves can be either a large sink or a source for atmospheric CO2. This CO2 sink/source term may substantially alter our current view of the global carbon budget for land and oceans. However, past fieldwork and synthesis have focused on a few shelves in the northern temperate zone while the vast majority of other shelves are ignored. By dividing the highly heterogeneous shelves into seven provinces, we suggest that the continental shelves are a sink for atmospheric CO2 at mid-high latitudes (−0.33 Pg C a−1) and a source of CO2 at low latitudes (0.11 Pg C a−1). Warm temperature and high terrestrial organic carbon input are most likely responsible for the CO2 release in low latitude shelves.},

@article{collins_california_2003,
	Abstract = {Repeated hydrobiological surveys over the period 1988--2002 perpendicular to the central California coast indicate strong coupling between physical circulation and biological production. An equatorward-flowing jet about 100--200km from shore marked the inshore edge of the California Current (CC). This ``CC Jet'' had its highest velocities during late winter and spring. The jet divided inshore, biologically productive waters from offshore, low-production waters. Mean flow in the inshore waters is poleward. However, this flow is interrupted in late spring and summer by a surface-enhanced, equatorward-flowing, coastal upwelling jet. The upwelling jet coincides with maxima of nutrients, chlorophyll-a and primary production. Annual variability in the inshore zone is related to (1) vertical pycnocline movements associated with geostrophic adjustments to accelerations of the California Current system, and (2) coastal upwelling. In offshore waters, the annual cycle accounted for a small fraction of the variability, indicating the dominance of eddies and meanders in this zone (J. Geophys. Res. 92 (1987) 12947). The offshore regime was mesotrophic to oligotrophic, with a subsurface chlorophyll-a maximum above the nutricline. Considerable subduction may occur under the California Current jet and be an important process in the export of biogenic material to the deep sea.},

	Abstract = {This work presents an estimate of anthropogenic CO2 in the Pacific Ocean based on measurements from the WOCE/JGOFS/OACES global CO2 survey. These estimates used a modified version of the ΔC* technique. Modifications include a revised preformed alkalinity term, a correction for denitrification, and an evaluation of the disequilibrium terms using an optimum multiparameter analysis. The total anthropogenic CO2 inventory over an area from 120$\,^{\circ}$E to 70$\,^{\circ}$W and 70$\,^{\circ}$S to 65$\,^{\circ}$N (excluding the South China Sea, the Yellow Sea, the Japan/East Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk) was 44.5 $\pm$ 5 Pg C in 1994. Approximately 28 Pg C was located in the Southern Hemisphere and 16.5 Pg C was located north of the equator. The deepest penetration of anthropogenic CO2 is found at about 50$\,^{\circ}$S. The shallowest penetration is found just north of the equator. Very shallow anthropogenic CO2 penetration is also generally observed in the high-latitude Southern Ocean. One exception to this is found in the far southwestern Pacific where there is evidence of anthropogenic CO2 in the northward moving bottom waters. In the North Pacific a strong zonal gradient is observed in the anthropogenic CO2 penetration depth with the deepest penetration in the western Pacific. The Pacific has the largest total inventory in all of the southern latitudes despite the fact that it generally has the lowest average inventory when normalized to a unit area. The lack of deep and bottom water formation in the North Pacific means that the North Pacific inventories are smaller than the North Atlantic.},

The leading 3-dimensional multivariate empirical orthogonal functions (3D EOFs) of the CCS circulation were computed and provide a detailed view of low-frequency circulation variability within the CCS. The 3D EOFs are used as basis functions for a linear inverse model of the circulation, and several Principal Oscillation Patterns (POPs) of the circulation are identified. The leading POPs have periods in the range ∼4−10 years, and shed light on the 3-dimensional time evolving structure associated with low-frequency variability in the circulation. A particular focus here is coastal upwelling. In particular, a POP with a period close to 10 years appears to be preferentially excited as a resonant response to forcing associated with the regional expression of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation and the El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation.},

	Abstract = {Ensemble approaches are becoming widely used in climate research. In contrast to weather forecast, however, in the climatic context one is interested in long-time properties, those arising on the scale of several decades. The well-known strong internal variability of the climate system implies the existence of a related dynamical attractor with chaotic properties. Under the condition of climate change this should be a snapshot attractor, naturally arising in an ensemble-based framework. Although ensemble averages can be evaluated at any instant of time, results obtained during the process of convergence of the ensemble towards the attractor are not relevant from the point of view of climate. In simulations, therefore, attention should be paid to whether the convergence to the attractor has taken place.

	Abstract = {The Angola--Benguela frontal zone of the South-East Atlantic Ocean was investigated by means of satellite-derived weekly maps of sea surface temperature for the period 1982--1985. The investigation shows that the Angola--Benguela front is a permanent feature at the sea surface and is maintained throughout the year in a narrow band of latitude, between 14 and 16$\,^{\circ}$S, with a general west to east orientation. Seasonal fluctuations of the front occur with regard to geographical location, width, seaward extent, temperature gradient and eddy formation in the frontal zone. The position of the front comes about as a result of a combination of factors, the most notable being wind stress, coastal orientation, bottom topography and north and south movements of warm and cold water associated with the Angola Current and the Benguela upwelling system.},

@article{shannon_large-_1987,
	Abstract = {Large- and mesoscale features of the frontal system which separates the waters of the Benguela and Angola systems are described. Although salinity data suggest that the front may extend to a depth of at least 200 m, it is particularly marked in the upper 50 m where it can be defined in terms of both temperature and salinity. A horizontal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient of 4$\,^{\circ}$C per 1$\,^{\circ}$ of latitude is typical near the coast, and the position of the zone of maximum gradient varies seasonally between, on average, 15 and 17$\,^{\circ}$S, i.e. off southern Angola. The front corresponds to the convergence zone between the north-moving surface waters of the Benguela (modified Central Water) and the south-flowing Angola Current, which is of mixed tropical/equatorial origin and, as such, marks the northern boundary of the Benguela and the southern boundary of the intense shallow thermocline which is a permanent feature off Angola. An analysis of many observations by season shows that mesoscale poleward-directed tongue-like intrusions are a feature of the front. These are evident also in the synoptic SST distribution. Two case studies, one spanning a week in summer and the other a similar period in winter, of the SST show substantial short-term variability in the surface expression of the front, evidently related to the meteorology of the area. Double fronts are evident, on occasions, from satellite thermal infra-red imagery of the area. Their origin is discussed.},

@article{shannon_existence_1986,
	Abstract = {Since the early 1950s, although there have been several warm and cool periods in the Benguela region off southwestern Africa, e.g. the warm event in the southern part of the system during the austral summer of 1982/83, only two events which approximate to an El Ni{\~n}o-type situation have occurred, viz in 1963 and in 1984. During the 1963 event temperatures 2--4$\,^{\circ}$C and salinities 0.1--0.2 × 10−3 above normal were recorded in the upper 50 m off Namibia up to at least 150 km offshore. The pressure adjusted sea level during 1963 was on average 4 cm above the mean. During early 1984 an intrusion of equatorial water moved southward along the coast of northern and central Namibia to 25S. This most recent Benguela Ni{\~n}o was preceded by an extended period of vigorous upwelling during 1982 and 1983. Higher than average pressure adjusted sea levels were recorded at Walvis Bay between October 1983 and September 1984 with maximum positive monthly anomalies of 7 cm during March and August 1984. Equatorward windstress was above average during both the 1963 and 1984 events. Although long time series in the Benguela are few, historic records indicate that in March 1950 the 27$\,^{\circ}$C isotherm in the eastern Atlantic lay 600 km further south than normal, while there is evidence that a major El Ni{\~n}o-like event occurred here between February and August 1934, with sea temperatures 2--3$\,^{\circ}$C above the long term average from March to July 1934. During the 1934 perturbation there was a reported slackening and reversal of the usual equatorward surface flow of the Benguela current and abnormally high rainfall occurred which resulted in extensive flooding of Namib Desert rivers. High rainfall over the Namib was recorded in 1950 and 1963 while some flooding occurred in 1984. Conditions were clearly anomalous in low latitudes in the Atlantic in 1934 and 1963, while there was a major perturbation in the equatorial Atlantic in 1984. This strongly suggests a nonlocal cause of the Benguela anomalies. It is suggested that there is a South Atlantic equivalent of the Pacific El Ni{\~n}o, but that in the Benguela region these events are less pronounced and less frequent. Their causal mechanism may also be different. The effect of these events on the southern Benguela is minimal.},

@article{boyd_spatial_1992,
	Abstract = {Currents on the South African shelf have been measured on 13 cruises since an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was installed on F.R.S. Africana in 1989. Most previous descriptions of the West Coast (Benguela) system, including the baroclinic jet currents off the Cape Peninsula and Cape Columbine, the latter clearly diverging into a dominant offshore arm and a weaker inshore arm, have been confirmed. This baroclinic flow originates along the south-western margin of the Agulhas Bank. Measurements of the inshore features of the Agulhas Current have shown strong WSW -- SSW flow aligned with the bathymetry, but with significant shelf-edge north-eastward return flows. The velocity differences between the surface and depth reveal barotropic dominance in all inshore areas and over the central Agulhas Bank. The West Coast outer shelf displays variable baroclinic effects, reflecting the importance of frontal features and cross-shelf flow. SSW flow on the outer eastern Agulhas Bank appears responsible for an offshore loss of eggs from this region. The funnelling of anchovy eggs from the western Agulhas Bank to the West Coast was clear, but this "funnel" was found to have holes through which substantial loss of eggs offshore is also probable. The currents on the Agulhas Bank and the West Coast are discussed with regard to the life histories of various commercially fished species, in addition to anchovy. The study concludes that hypotheses relating environmental factors and recruitment need to consider the variety of potential options in terms of life history contained within the prevailing current system.},

@article{hagen_seasonal_2001,
	Abstract = {Monthly maps of remotely sensed sea surface temperatures derived from NOAA/AVHRR thermal images are used to describe changes in `Intense Benguela Upwelling' during 1982--1999. The coastal area under investigation lies between 9--34$\,^{\circ}$ S and 8--20$\,^{\circ}$ E and the total area of cold water between the coast and the course of the 13 $\,^{\circ}$C isotherm is considered to be an index of intense, active upwelling. It exhibits a decreasing trend over the study period of 18 years and some evidence for a quasi-cycle of about 27 months. Seasonal cycles are discussed for the total cold water area as well as for its mean alongshore and offshore extents. The main season of cold surface water was found to occur between July and September during the austral winter. It peaks in August with a mean area of about 30×103 km2 and relaxes drastically during the rest of the year. The underlying process of intense coastal upwelling is regionally trapped in two coastal zones. These are centred around 26 and 29$\,^{\circ}$ S and reach a mean offshore extension of 210 and 130 km, respectively, to form giant upwelling filaments. The area of cold water drastically shrinks, roughly by a factor of two, during weak upwelling years but significantly expands by a factor of about 1.5 during strong years. Associated sea level changes along the south-west African coast were derived from measurements at four coastal stations between 23 and 34$\,^{\circ}$ S during 1982--1987. The first principal component describes about 63 \% of the total sea level variance. The lowest sea levels were found in the prominent L{\"u}deritz cell near 26$\,^{\circ}$ S. On both the annual and interannual time scale, decreasing cold water areas are accompanied by increasing sea levels and vice versa. Mean seasonal cycles reveal that variations in the total cold water area lag behind those in the sea level along the entire south-west African coast by about 1 month.

	Abstract = {Models and observations of atmospheric potential oxygen (APO ≃ O2 + 1.1 * CO2) are used to investigate the influence of El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on air-sea O2 exchange. An atmospheric transport inversion of APO data from the Scripps flask network shows significant interannual variability in tropical APO fluxes that is positively correlated with the Ni{\~n}o3.4 index, indicating anomalous ocean outgassing of APO during El Ni{\~n}o. Hindcast simulations of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace model show similar APO sensitivity to ENSO, differing from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model, which shows an opposite APO response. In all models, O2 accounts for most APO flux variations. Detailed analysis in CESM shows that the O2 response is driven primarily by ENSO modulation of the source and rate of equatorial upwelling, which moderates the intensity of O2 uptake due to vertical transport of low-O2 waters. These upwelling changes dominate over counteracting effects of biological productivity and thermally driven O2 exchange. During El Ni{\~n}o, shallower and weaker upwelling leads to anomalous O2 outgassing, whereas deeper and intensified upwelling during La Ni{\~n}a drives enhanced O2 uptake. This response is strongly localized along the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, leading to an equatorial zonal dipole in atmospheric anomalies of APO. This dipole is further intensified by ENSO-related changes in winds, reconciling apparently conflicting APO observations in the tropical Pacific. These findings suggest a substantial and complex response of the oceanic O2 cycle to climate variability that is significantly ({\textgreater}50\%) underestimated in magnitude by ocean models.},

Here we use a suite of three hindcast simulations with the Regional Oceanic Modeling System to assess the responsible mechanisms for this development. We find that the early buildup was primarily driven by the early onset of this event in the tropical Pacific, driving anomalies in the CalCS through the propagation of coastally trapped waves. In contrast, the abrupt end in the central CalCS was caused by the unusual onset of upwelling favorable winds in the fall of 2015, which offset the continuing remote forcing through the coastal waveguide. Nevertheless, low-nutrient anomalies persisted, causing anomalously low phytoplankton abundance in the upwelling season of 2016. This is a recurring pattern for all El Ni{\~n}o events over the last 37 years, suggesting predictive skill on seasonal timescales.},

@article{frischknecht_remote_2015,
	Abstract = {Much of the observed interannual variability in the physical and biogeochemical state of the California Current System (CalCS) is associated with El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation. Yet it is unclear whether this is primarily a result of atmospheric teleconnections forcing the ocean locally through changes in wind and fluxes of heat and freshwater, or whether this is a consequence of oceanic interior processes that transport tropical variability through, e.g., coastally trapped waves to the region. Here we investigate the relative contribution of these two mechanisms in the CalCS using a novel setup of the Regional Oceanic Modeling System coupled to a biogeochemical/ecological model. We conducted a hindcast simulation over the period 1979--2013 and contrast the results with those from sensitivity simulations with climatological atmospheric boundary conditions either for the U.S. West Coast or the rest of the Pacific. We find that remote forcing dominates the variability of the physical state in the nearshore region of the CalCS, explaining up to 80\% of monthly mean sea-surface height and temperature variability. In contrast, local processes tend to drive variations in the biogeochemical/ecological state, particularly along central and northern California, explaining up to 50\% of the observed surface variability. Most of the remote forcing is a consequence of coastally trapped waves that travel northward at speeds of approximately 230 km d−1, and thereby alter sea-level height, thermocline structure, and upwelling along California. Biogeochemically active tracers respond to this remote forcing as well, especially at depth, but are more strongly modulated by local atmospheric forcing, especially variations in upwelling-favorable winds.},

	Abstract = {The upper ocean dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration is regulated by advective and diffusive transport divergence, biological processes, freshwater and air-sea CO2 fluxes. The relative importance of these mechanisms in the Southern Ocean is uncertain, as year-round observations in this area have been limited. We use a novel physical-biogeochemical state estimate of the Southern Ocean to construct a closed DIC budget of the top 650 m and investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the different components of the carbon system. The dominant mechanisms of variability in upper ocean DIC depend on location and time and space scales considered. Advective transport is the most influential mechanism and governs the local DIC budget across the 10 day to 5-year timescales analyzed. Diffusive effects are nearly negligible. The large-scale transport structure is primarily set by up- and downwelling, though both the lateral ageostrophic and geostrophic transports are significant. In the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the carbon budget components are also influenced by the presence of topography and biological hot spots. In the subtropics, evaporation and air-sea CO2 flux primarily balances the sink due to biological production and advective transport. Finally, in the subpolar region sea ice processes, which change the seawater volume and thus the DIC concentration, compensate the large impact of the advective transport and modulate the timing of biological activity and air-sea CO2 flux.},

@article{nam_amplification_2011,
	Abstract = {Low-oxygen and low-pH events are an increasing concern and threat in the Eastern Pacific coastal waters, and can be lethal for benthic and demersal organisms on the continental shelf. The normal seasonal cycle includes uplifting of isopycnals during upwelling in spring, which brings low-oxygen and low-pH water onto the shelf. Five years of continuous observations of subsurface dissolved oxygen off Southern California, reveal large additional oxygen deficiencies relative to the seasonal cycle during the latest La Ni{\~n}a event. While some changes in oxygen related to the isopycnal depression/uplifting during El Ni{\~n}o/La Ni{\~n}a are not unexpected, the observed oxygen changes are 2--3 times larger than what can be explained by cross-shore exchanges. In late summer 2010, oxygen levels at mid-depth of the water column reached values of 2.5 ml/L, which is much lower than normal oxygen levels at this time of the seasons, 4--5 ml/L. The extra uplifting of isopycnals related to the La Ni{\~n}a event can explain oxygen reductions only to roughly 3.5 ml/L. We find that the additional oxygen decrease beyond that is strongly correlated with decreased subsurface primary production and strengthened poleward flows by the California Undercurrent. The combined actions of these three processes created a La Ni{\~n}a-caused oxygen decrease as large and as long as the normal seasonal minimum during upwelling period in spring, but later in the year. With a different timing of a La Ni{\~n}a, the seasonal oxygen minimum and the La Ni{\~n}a anomaly could overlap to potentially create hypoxic events of previously not observed magnitudes.},

	Abstract = {The near-term progression of ocean acidification (OA) is projected to bring about sharp changes in the chemistry of coastal upwelling ecosystems. The distribution of OA exposure across these early-impact systems, however, is highly uncertain and limits our understanding of whether and how spatial management actions can be deployed to ameliorate future impacts. Through a novel coastal OA observing network, we have uncovered a remarkably persistent spatial mosaic in the penetration of acidified waters into ecologically-important nearshore habitats across 1,000 km of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. In the most severe exposure hotspots, suboptimal conditions for calcifying organisms encompassed up to 56\% of the summer season, and were accompanied by some of the lowest and most variable pH environments known for the surface ocean. Persistent refuge areas were also found, highlighting new opportunities for local adaptation to address the global challenge of OA in productive coastal systems.},

@article{alin_robust_2012,
	Abstract = {The California Current System (CCS) is expected to experience the ecological impacts of ocean acidification (OA) earlier than most other ocean regions because coastal upwelling brings old, CO2-rich water relatively close to the surface ocean. Historical inorganic carbon measurements are scarce, so the progression of OA in the CCS is unknown. We used a multiple linear regression approach to generate empirical models using oxygen (O2), temperature (T), salinity (S), and sigma theta (σθ) as proxy variables to reconstruct pH, carbonate saturation states, carbonate ion concentration ([CO32−]), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration, and total alkalinity (TA) in the southern CCS. The calibration data included high-quality measurements of carbon, oxygen, and other hydrographic variables, collected during a cruise from British Columbia to Baja California in May--June 2007. All resulting empirical relationships were robust, withr2values {\textgreater}0.92 and low root mean square errors. Estimated and measured carbon chemistry matched very well for independent data sets from the CalCOFI and IMECOCAL programs. Reconstructed CCS pH and saturation states for 2005--2011 reveal a pronounced seasonal cycle and inter-annual variability in the upper water column. Deeper in the water column, conditions are stable throughout the annual cycle, with perennially low pH and saturation states. Over sub-decadal time scales, these empirical models provide a valuable tool for reconstructing carbonate chemistry related to ocean acidification where direct observations are limited. However, progressive increases in anthropogenic CO2 content of southern CCS water masses must be carefully addressed to apply the models over longer time scales.},

@article{riahi_shared_2017,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400--1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2$\,^{\circ}$C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

@article{zheng_response_2017,
	Abstract = {El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of variability in the coupled ocean-atmospheric system. Future projections of ENSO change under global warming are highly uncertain among models. In this study, the effect of internal variability on ENSO amplitude change in future climate projections is investigated based on a 40-member ensemble from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) project. A large uncertainty is identified among ensemble members due to internal variability. The inter-member diversity is associated with a zonal dipole pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) change in the mean along the equator, which is similar to the second empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode of tropical Pacific decadal variability (TPDV) in the unforced control simulation. The uncertainty in CESM-LE is comparable in magnitude to that among models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5), suggesting the contribution of internal variability to the intermodel uncertainty in ENSO amplitude change. However, the causations between changes in ENSO amplitude and the mean state are distinct between CESM-LE and CMIP5 ensemble. The CESM-LE results indicate that a large ensemble of {\textasciitilde}15 members is needed to separate the relative contributions to ENSO amplitude change over the twenty-first century between forced response and internal variability.},
